	abstract = {The tufas of the presently shallow Chlupáčova sluj Cave document an unusual history of deeper to shallower hydrologic processes in cave evolution. The wider geological context of the cave, along with fluid inclusion and stable isotope (C and O) analyses of calcite from tectonic veins cutting through its wallrock, are evidence of the origin of the cave in the deeper subsurface, under the influence of ascending 25–70 °C warm, saline (2.0–22.3 wt% eq. NaCl) waters driven by regional hypogene processes. The formation of calcite veins, which occurred at 700–400 ka, was probably coeval with the early stages of cave development. However, two generations of tufa formed in the later Pleistocene during the mature shallow-subsurface stage of cave development when daylight and cold meteoric waters penetrated the cave through ceiling windows and tectonic fractures. The first-generation tufa, which consists of cauliflower-like aggregates of hollow, outward-radiating carbonate tubules covered with isopachous banded calcite cements, is interpreted as ancient bryophyte tufa that was deposited about 620 ± 140–530 ± 110 ka. The presence of microscopic biomorphic fabrics resembling micro-stromatolites, calcareous algal chambers, calcite crystals with cloudy cores and clear sparitic rims, and specific biomarkers identified in tufa extracts suggest that, in addition to mosses, algae and bacteria may have also been instrumental in promoting the deposition of tufa. Tufa stable isotope (C and O) characteristics and fluid inclusion contents point to deposition of this first-generation tufa from fresh water with a minor admixture of higher hydrocarbons at the surface temperature. Post-dating the first-generation tufa, minute grains of exotic minerals (e.g. stibnite, gothic-arch calcite, gypsum, Mn-minerals, opaline silica) and sparry calcite were precipitated in the tufa moulds and between carbonate tubules as cements. These minerals suggest at least one event in which hydrothermal waters entered the cave from below after deposition of the first tufa from cool meteoric waters. In this hydrothermal phase, the cave may have been a hot spring. The second-generation tufa originated during the Riss – Würm Interglacial at 121 ± 2.1–107 ± 2.6 ka, following a period of intense water erosion that partly erased older spelean deposits from cave walls. This tufa consists of highly porous, friable, crudely laminated carbonate sediments with floral and molluscan remains, characteristic of common cold-water karstic tufa. This and the earlier tufa were, in turn, covered by later fine-grained cave sediments, contributing to the preservation of Pleistocene tufa that records an alternation of deep and shallow waters in the cave over at least the last 500,000 years. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Calcareous fens represent an endangered type of peatlands, acting as refugia for stress-tolerant species in the currently changing landscapes. The resurveys across many regions have reported their recent disappearance or deterioration despite both the extreme habitat conditions (carbonate richness, presence of calcareous tufa, nutrient limitation, high water level) and conservation management. To test the stability of their biotic communities in different environmental and management configurations, we repeatedly sampled molluscs (terrestrial and aquatic), vascular plants, and bryophytes at 30 calcareous fens in the Inner Western Carpathians (Slovakia, Poland) after 13–17 years of warm summers and land-use changes. We found a small yet statistically significant effect of sampling period (old versus new survey) on the species composition of all three groups of organisms when the effect of various positions of sites along ecological gradients was controlled for. The compositional changes, interpreted with the help of Ellenberg Indicator Values, suggest an incipient succession towards grasslands and shrublands, driven by decreasing soil moisture and increasing nutrient availability. Although the number of habitat specialists did not change, the number of matrix-derived vascular plant and bryophyte species significantly increased, with six ubiquitous species of productive habitats being significantly more represented currently, while the richness of aquatic molluscs significantly decreased. Fens in which potentially strongly competitive plant species were less stressed because of less intense management and lower habitat extremity were more prone to such succession. There was no single factor that could predict the magnitude of composition changes; instead, tested factors were found to act synergistically. Conservation management was predominantly important for bryophytes, while extreme habitat conditions were predominantly important for terrestrial snails. We suggested a way how nature conservancy authorities can prioritise the management needs by applying an abiotic indicator system, with less environmentally extreme fens requiring more intense conservation management. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The tufa record and hydrochemical characteristics of the River Piedra in the Monasterio de Piedra Natural Park (NE Spain) were studied for 6 years. The mean discharge of this river was 1.22 m3/s. The water was supersaturated with calcium carbonate. The HCO3-, Ca2+ and TDIC concentrations decreased along the 0.5-km-long studied stretch, whereas the calcite SI showed no systematic downstream or seasonal variation over the same stretch. Several sedimentary subenvironments exist in which four broad types of tufa facies form: (1) Dense laminated tufa (stromatolites), (2) Dense to porous, massive tufa, (3) Porous, coarsely laminated tufa with bryophytes and algae, and (4) Dense, hard, laminated deposits in caves. The half-yearly period thickness and weight of sediment accumulated on 14 tablets installed in several subenvironments showed that the deposition rate was greater in fast flowing river areas and in stepped waterfalls, and lower in slow flowing or standing river areas and in spray and splash areas. Mechanical CO2 outgassing is the main factor controlling calcite precipitation on the river bed and in waterfalls, but this process does not explain the seasonal changes in depositional rates. The deposition rates showed a half-yearly period pattern recorded in all fluvial subenvironments persistent over time (5.26 mm, 0.86 g/cm2 in warm periods; 2.26 mm, 0.13 g/cm2 in cool periods). Mass balance calculations showed higher calcite mass values in warm (21.58 mg/L) than in cool (13.68 mg/L) periods. This biannual variation is mainly attributed to the seasonal differences in temperature that caused changes in inorganic calcite precipitation rate and in biomass and the correlative photosynthetic activity. Tufa sedimentation was therefore controlled by both physicochemical and biological processes. The results of this study may help test depositional rates and their environmental controls and thus assess the climatic and hydrological significance of ancient tufas in semi-arid conditions, in particular in the Quaternary. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

Two further phosphorus fractions contained significant amounts of P. The dithionite fraction ranged from 10-27% of the total, and most of this fraction was probably associated with detrital iron minerals. The alkali-soluble fraction which removed most of the organically-bound P was highest in the modern bryophyte tufas. Total P levels in the tufas ranged from 33-119 ppm. These are low values for stream sediments. Phosphorus uptake rates into tufa were estimated for these sites.

	abstract = {Western-Carpathian travertine fens developed on deep-circulation groundwater are highly localised and harbour unique communities that combine rare species of calcareous fens and salt marshes, with many species considered glacial or Early-Holocene relicts. Using a multi-proxy palaeoecological approach, we tested the assumption of naturalness and Holocene continuity of the current plant and mollusc communities occupying one of the best-preserved travertine fens in Europe. Our novel results, based on two complete cores throughout the fen deposits, document an anthropogenic origin of the current communities, despite their richness in rare and relict species. The habitat originated in the very beginning of the Holocene, later it was encroached by a semi-open woodland with spruce and alder and then by a dense reed bed that suppressed fen species even more than woodland encroachment. When compared with a fen site on shallow-circulation groundwater, the Holocene succession to woodlands has been blocked by travertine formation, allowing survival of light-demanding relicts in small patches. The current communities were established once the woody plants, and especially reed, were reduced by medieval land use. The community itself is therefore not relict, but it harbours probable descendants of relict populations that survived in neighbouring small refugia throughout the Holocene. Our results strongly support the need for active conservation actions as mowing and extensive grazing, mimicking the traditional type of land use, which has conditioned the recent travertine assemblages in the past. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Middle Eocene and Oligocene basins in northwestern half of Mallorca are filled by detrital rocks (conglomerates, calcarenites and lutites) and carbonates deposited in alluvial, fluvial, palustrine and lacustrine settings. The sediment supplied to these continental basins was transported by alkaline, bicarbonate-rich waters. As a consequence, these non-marine carbonate deposits display extensive developments of diverse kinds of organosedimentary facies. The sedimentary record from three localities (Peguera, Alaró and Sineu) enabled one to characterize well-preserved Eocene tufa deposits as well as Eocene and Oligocene stromatolites and oncolites. A total of ten carbonate facies are described and interpreted. The facies related to tufa deposits are diverse types of boundstones, rudstones and packstones of bryophytes, in situ stems s.l., phytoclasts, etc. and associated oncolite rudstones and bioclastic mudstones-to-packstones. These facies deposited in littoral lacustrine and fluvio-lacustrine environments. Oncolites and stromatolites present a great variety of shapes and sizes (oncolites from centimetres to several meters in diameter) that somehow were conditioned by environmental conditions within shallow lacustrine and fluvial settings. Three types of lamination apparently dependent on the type of microorganisms responsible for calcite precipitation are distinguished (fan-shaped and bush-shaped grouped filaments and isolated to loosely grouped filaments). The δ13C and δ18O composition of these deposits agrees with carbonate precipitation in freshwater, hydrologically open systems with similar carbon sources throughout the Eocene and Oligocene. However, Eocene and Oligocene samples are set apart by the δ18O. Oligocene facies present lower δ18O values, which might indicate deposition from isotopically less evolved waters, perhaps under slightly greater precipitation/evaporation conditions. Tufa facies have the highest δ13C composition and show some positive covariation of δ13C and δ18O, primarily reflecting the effects of physical and biological CO2 outgassing, and maybe also minor evaporation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {A complex of inactive tufas, the thickness of which reaches 3.5 m, was studied in the lowermost segment of the Sąspowska Valley in the Kraków Upland (Ojców National Park, Poland). Five fluvial tufa barrages were recognized. They are composed of moss tufa and stromatolitic tufa accompanied with oncoidal rudstone and detrital tufa. Interbarrage ponded areas were filled with detrital tufa, lutite, and subordinately oncoidal rudstone, limestone gravel and peat-like deposit. Radiocarbon dates suggest that the tufa formed during Subboreal, Boreal and Atlantic time. The main difference between the tufa in the Sąspowska Valley and contemporaneous tufas in other valleys of the Kraków Upland is the higher amount of non-carbonate fraction in the former. Other Lower and Middle Holocene tufas of the Kraków Upland are composed mainly or exclusively of carbonate fraction. The non-carbonate fraction in fluviatile tufas in the Sąspowska Valley resulted from erosion of loess cover in the upper part of the catchment. The erosion was related to local activity of Neolithic flint miners who cleared forest at a local scale, dug shafts in loess cover and exploited flints from underlying weathered residuum of Jurassic limestone. Consequently, they made copious amounts of loose material available for transport down the valley and subsequent trapping within the tufa depositional system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA},

Eight associations of tufa and related carbonate facies, plus minor polygenic detrital facies, represent the processes that occurred in different fluvial and related environments. The bedrock lithology and structure controlled the location of the knickpoints along the valley and allowed separation of two stepped stretches with distinct conceptual facies models. The moderate-slope model includes extensive standing-water areas dammed by barrage-cascades. In the lakes, bioclastic silts, sands and limestones along with phytoclastic and marly, at places peaty, sediments formed. Abundant stem phytoherms account for extensive palustrine areas. The high-slope model consists of smaller dammed areas between close-up cascades and barrage-cascades, which were composed primarily of moss phytoherms and phytoclastic tufas. An outstanding feature is the extensive steep reach with phytoclastic and polygenic detrital sediments, and stepped cascades consisting of stromatolitic and moss phytoherms. There, the steep slope limited the preservation of stem phytoherms and favoured erosion. The geometry and thickness of the sedimentary fill (wedge-shaped units composed of cascade and barrage-cascade deposits downstream, and dammed and gentle-sloped channel deposits upstream) are therefore different for each model. Multi-storey wedges are a distinctive feature of the high-slope model. The initial knickpoint geometry and the tufa aggradation/progradation ratio on such steep surfaces (for example, related to changes in discharge) controlled the growth style of the cascades or barrage-cascades and, hence, the extent, thickness and vertical evolution of the upstream deposits. The sedimentological attributes and stable-isotope composition of the carbonate facies suggest a higher and more variable precipitation/evaporation ratio during the Pleistocene than during the Holocene, consistent with an overall decrease in the river discharge. This evolution was coupled with warm conditions, which prevailed during the stages of tufa formation. These results may help to assess architectural patterns in interpreting other basins, and underscore the significance of tufas as records of past hydrology and climate. © 2013 International Association of Sedimentologists.},

	abstract = {An unexpected concentration of calcicole mosses and lichens has been discovered at and near a small spring seep on the granite headwall of the North Basin of Mt. Katahdin, Piscataquis County, Maine. Water samples from the spring were circumneutral and high in calcium ion content, whereas other springs, ponds, and streams on the mountain tested acidic and low in calcium. Because the Katahdin granite contains no primary carbonate minerals, it is suggested that the source of calcium enrichment in the North Basin spring water is secondary calcium carbonate (calcite) precipitated in cavities and fractures near the base of the upper Katahdin granite and its subsequent dissolution and mobilization by percolating groundwater. Plagioclase, epidote, and other calcic minerals in the granite supply the primary calcium ions. The moss calcicoles grew in small discontinuous patches on wet humified peaty soil over alpine bedrock ledges in communities having floristics and water chemistry similar to lowland rich fens. Present in or near the seep were mosses previously unrecorded for New England or Maine [Loeskypnum wickesiae (Grout) Tuom., Neckera oligocarpa Bruch in Hartm., Pseudoleskea radicosa (Mitt.) Mac. & Kindb., Tortella tortuosa var. fragilifolia (Jur.) Limpr., Warnstorfia sarmentosa (Wahlenb.) Hedenäs], one lichen [Hymenelia cyanocarpa (Anzi) Lutzoni], reported here for the first time from North America, and another lichen (Thelidium minutulum Körb.) for the first time from the contiguous United States. An area adjacent to the seep, but unaffected by calcareous seep-water, was remarkable for a concentration of rare lichen species of acidic rocks, including Catillaria contristans (NyI.) Zahlbr. and Lecanora caesiosora Poelt, that have not previously been reported from North America. The bryophyte and lichen flora of the seep area is an example of a Holocene alpine microrefugium. Refugia such as these can serve as a source of propagules that allow new populations to establish elsewhere in mountainous terrain, or beyond, during climatic and other environmental change. Therefore, extant, cryptic microrefugia are important biogeographically and especially worthy of preservation efforts.},

	abstract = {Protection and restoration of the CaCO3 depositing alkaline fens require an in-depth understanding of these unique and declining ecosystems. The present study investigates the development of the formerly heavy tufa depositing alkaline fen in East-Central Europe after CaCO3 precipitation markedly declined ca. 5400 cal yr BP. By combining palaeoecological and monitoring data, we aim to identify the limiting factors for tufa deposition and to recognise the vegetation and mollusc response to the change. Investigation of the current fen ecosystem included a botanical and malacological inventory and a monthly monitoring of the physicochemical properties of the groundwater emerging at the fen. It was also tested whether CaCO3 precipitates there. Transformations of the fen ecosystem since the mid-Holocene tufa decline were recognized by applying plant macrofossil and malacological analyses supplemented with organic matter and CaCO3 contents and the radiocarbon chronologies of the sediment cores. Although macroscopic tufa is currently not observed at the fen surface, the monitoring study revealed the microscopic calcite crystals at the glass slides during the spring and summer. A combination of cooling, gradual depletion of the Ca2+ pool, acidification of soils, and water table fluctuations was likely responsible for limiting tufa deposition in the mid-Holocene and maintaining this state during the late Holocene. Share of the calciphilous species' macrofossils (e.g. moss Tomentypnum nitens) declined following the sedimentary CaCO3 drop, whereas the contribution of species associated with high nutrient levels raised (e.g. Juncus articulatus). Inspection of the contemporary vegetation of the fen revealed that only Carex paniculata is associated with the calcium-rich substrate. The response of molluscs to the decline in tufa deposition remains unclear as mollusc shells did not preserve in CaCO3-depleted sediments, except for the youngest deposits. The present-day malacofauna consists of 21 species, including two rare and protected calciphilous species, namely Vertigo angustior and V. geyeri. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Tufas are freshwater carbonate rocks that form in continental environments through a combination of physical, chemical, and biological processes. This study investigates the role of microorganisms in the precipitation of Quaternary tufa deposits in the Serra da Bodoquena Formation, in the Bonito region. Two sites along the Mimoso River, named Taíka and Mimosa, characterized by the pool-barrage-cascade depositional subenvironment, were selected for this study. Four distinct facies were identified: stromatolitic boundstones, phytoherm boundstones of algae, phytoherm boundstones of bryophytes, and phytoclastic rudstones. These facies were observed in diverse hydrological settings, including fast-flowing waters, such as waterfalls and cascades, as well as slow-flowing areas, such as pools and dams. The δ18O depletion indicated a meteoric origin for the fluid involved in carbonate precipitation. The low δ13C values were attributed to photosynthetic processes and the contribution of light carbon-enriched groundwater. The presence of Oocardium stratum and calcified organic mucilage from extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) corroborates the significant role of microorganisms in tufa formation, particularly in stromatolitic boundstones and phytoherm boundstones of algae. Rapid CO2 degassing significantly contributes to mineralization in fast-flowing waters. Micro-CT results offer detailed insights into the relationship between mechanical processes and biological influences in shaping porosity characteristics. The findings of this study significantly enhance our understanding of the role of microorganisms in tufa formation, highlighting the complex interplay between biotic and abiotic processes in the development of different tufa facies. Moreover, the insights gained from this study provide valuable implications for interpreting tufa deposits worldwide. © The Author(s), 2024.},

Our results indicate that meiofauna were a constant and abundant component in bryophytes and tufa. Of the nine identified groups (Catenulida, Gastrotricha, Nematoda, Rotifera, Hydrachnidia, Oligochaeta, Copepoda, Tardigrada and Chironomidae (Diptera)), rotifers (50%) and nematodes (40%) were most abundant. Rotifers were the most diverse meiofaunal group and reached their highest numbers within the bryophytes. Also, the highest amount of ultrafine particulate organic matter, as a potential food source for rotifers, was recorded in this layer. Nematodes were the dominant meiofaunal group in deeper tufa layers. They are an omnivorous trophic group and different food sources (such as phytal remains or other meiofauna) were available in tufa layers. Meiofaunal assemblages were significantly nested and their composition was under the influence of community established in surface bryophyte mats. Information on these often overlooked faunal groups is essential for estimates of overall abundance, species richness and productivity in freshwater ecosystems. © CSIRO 2017.},

Different tufa facies related to distinct fluvial subenvironments were characterized and the isotopic composition of water was analysed seasonally. Sedimentary features (thickness, texture and structure) and stable isotope composition of the seasonal record on tablets were analysed. The seasonal intervals were identified from six-monthly thickness measurements on tablets. Sedimentation rates had a strong seasonal pattern with higher values in warm periods than in cool ones, although erosive events and sporadic, warmer-than-normal climate conditions altered it. Three main types of fluvial facies were studied in detail: dense, stromatolitic tufa; dense to porous, massive tufa; and spongy, moss-and alga-bearing, crudely laminated tufa. Textural features of deposits from warm and cool periods had a variable pattern. The sediment δ18O composition showed a rhythmic variation, with higher values in cool periods and lower in warm ones, caused by the fractionation due to seasonal temperature variations. The calculated temperatures for a theoretical equilibrium precipitation accord with the actual measured temperatures. The sediment d13C composition had an irregular pattern, indicating that other parameters than temperature intervened in the fluvial system. © The Geological Society of London 2010.},

This study was conducted in Plitvice lakes National Park (Croatia) representing a wide variety of freshwater habitats (springs, streams, lakes and tufa barriers). Adults were collected monthly from March 2007 until March 2009 using pyramid-type emergence traps at 13 locations. A total of 3865 specimens comprising 18 species were collected.

Considerable differences in composition and structure of aquatic dance flies assemblages were recorded along a longitudinal gradient of studied sites, primarily related to differences in physical and chemical parameters of water.

	abstract = {The Villaviciosa tufa building, on the banks of the Tajuña River, central Spain, is a recent perched springline tufa with four architectural elements: cascades, pools, channels, and barrages. The facies of the tufa building are LMC (low magnesium calcite) framestones of bryophytes, hanging stems, charophytes, phytoclastic rudstones, and rudstones of oncoids. Isotopic analyses give δ13C values ranging from − 8.05 to − 10.3‰ VPDB, and δ18O values from − 6.9 to − 7.45‰ VPDB. These values are in the range of most common tufa systems and such a short range of values is consistent with the Villaviciosa tufa building’s reduced dimensions. The mechanisms involved in precipitation vary within the building’s different environments, as reflected in the isotopic composition of the samples. Non-biogenic degassing values in cascade deposits (framestones of bryophytes) are the heaviest, whereas in pools, dominated by biogenic degassing, values for framestones of charophytes and phytoclasts are the lightest. Microbial bio-mediation is also strongly influenced by the development of oncoid, stromatolite, and bryophyte framestones. Temperature variation throughout the system of approximately 3 °C is not clearly reflected in the isotope signals. In short, in spite of the reduced dimensions of this tufa deposit, its notable environmental, facies, and geochemical variations may aid not only in the interpretation of detail of other tufa systems but also in the discussion of detailed facies analyses in paleoclimatic interpretations of this type of deposits. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Stalactitic deposits of subaerial tufa area common feature of humid tropical karst areas. Distinct from classic speleothems by dint of their epigean locations and tufaceous makeup, and from classic calcareous tufa by dint of their stalactitic form and subaerial depositional settings, these unique and rarely acknowledged sediments are intermediate forms between the two. They contain considerable organic material and provide habitats to a bewildering variety of living organisms, including bacteria, cyanobacteria, fungi, eukaryotic algae, bryophytes, higher plants, and invertebrates. Tufa stalactites are unique products of inorganic and biogenic carbonate deposition from dripping epikarstic water. The fundamental inorganic mechanisms (CO2-degassing and evaporative effects) are affected by a plethora of superimposed biological processes. The latter range from the largely inconsequential colonization and minor bioerosion to the significant photosynthetic enhancement of carbonate precipitation and direct biomineralization. These processes operate simultaneously and in complex interrelationships, and may produce distinct biogenic and bioconstructional fabrics and macromorphologies, the most apparent of which are the light-oriented stalactites commonly seen in the entrances of caves. © British Cave Research Association, 2004.},

	abstract = {Calcareous springs support bryophyte-dominated habitats relevant to biodiversity and conservation, but not much is known about the ecology of vascular plants restricted to these environments. Here, we investigate vegetation and hydrogeological patterns within the distribution of Centaurium somedanum, a threatened vascular plant endemic to mountain calcareous springs in the Cantabrian range (Spain). We studied the hydrogeological characteristics of the spring systems where this species occurs and identified three types of springs: (a) springs with active travertine deposition in small valleys, (b) springs in rock fall avalanches and (c) springs fed by calcareous water close to geological faults. Vascular plants and bryophytes co-occurring with the study species were sampled in 1-m2 plots to identify major vegetation types and to assess the relationships between species composition and topography. The presence of C. somedanum was associated with vegetation of calcareous spring fens (Caricion davallianae) in geological faults, tufa concretions (Adiantion) in active travertines, and another vegetation type of calcareous flushes (Pinguiculion) that was found in all of the spring types. C. somedanum shows a wider ecological range than other vascular plants of calcareous springs, occupying micro-habitats with similar cover of bryophytes but different from the cover of vascular plants. Although these plant communities are primarily dependent on the hydrology of springs, the variation in species composition is also correlated to the slope and solar radiation at the micro-scale. Our study demonstrates how a vascular plant with a calciphilic character may adapt to tufa-forming niches along the spring-flush-fen gradient, thus allowing it to occupy a wide range of habitats at different altitudes and geohydrological conditions. © 2013 Swiss Botanical Society.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacteria-dominated biofilms in a CO2-degassing karst-water creek (Westerhöfer Bach, Germany) were investigated with regard to the effects of microbial activity on CaCO3 precipitation, water chemistry of micro- and macroenvironments, stable isotopic records, and tufa fabric formation. Ex situ microelectrode measurements of pH, O2, Ca2+ and CO32- revealed that annually laminated calcified biofilms composed mainly of filamentous cyanobacteria (tufa stromatolites) strongly induced CaCO3 precipitation by photosynthesis under illumination, but inhibited precipitation by respiration in the dark. In contrast, endolithic cyanobacterial biofilms and mosses did not cause photosynthesis-induced precipitation under experimental conditions. No spontaneous precipitation occurred on bare limestone substrates, despite high calcite supersaturation of the ambient water. Mass balance calculations suggest that biofilm photosynthesis was responsible for 10-20% of Ca2+ loss in the creek, while the remaining Ca2+ loss derived from physicochemical precipitation on branches, leaves and as fine-grained calcite particles. Neither analysis of bulk water chemistry nor oxygen nor carbon stable isotopic records of the tufa stromatolites confirmed photosynthetic effects, despite the evident photosynthesis-induced calcite precipitation. Oxygen stable isotopic values reflected seasonal changes in water temperature, and carbon stable isotope values probably recorded carbon isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon in the creek water. Annual lamination and fabric formation of the tufa stromatolites is suggested to vary with photosynthesis-induced calcite precipitation rates that are affected by temperature dependency of diffusion coefficients. Photosynthesis-induced precipitation resulted in encrusted cyanobacterial sheaths, reflecting syntaxial overgrowth of microcrystalline cyanobacterial tubes by microspar, instead of microcrystalline sheath impregnation, which was previously suggested as an indicator of photosynthesis-induced precipitation. Therefore, sheath impregnation or encrustation by CaCO3 cannot be used to distinguish photosynthesis-induced from physicochemically-induced CaCO3 precipitation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The geochemistry of some modern, Holocene (4-4.5 ka) and Pleistocene (>100 ka) travertines from the UK is described. Four facies were recognized: one bryophyte, two algal and one clastic. In the Holocene travertine, from Gordale, Yorkshire, concentrations of Fe, Mn, Sr, Zn and the travertine porosity showed significant differences between facies that were related to the content of acid-insoluble residues and differences in meteoric diagenesis. The modern, active travertines, also from Gordale, similarly showed significant geochemical differences between facies types. All geochemical determinands in the modern travertines were higher by a factor of about two compared with the Holocene travertine. This is believed to be due to increased catchment erosion over the past few centuries and travertine deposits may therefore provide information on rates of soil erosion. The stable isotopic compositions of the travertine averaged -5.9%. for δ18O and -9.6‰ for δ13C, but there were no significant differences between the facies. Seventeen diatom taxa were found in the Holocene deposits but numbers were low when compared with the modern deposits, which were higher by a factor of about 1000. Dissolution of diatoms after burial would be sufficient to account for all of the authigenic quartz observed in these deposits. Four classes of organic matter were identified in the Holocene and Pleistocene samples: filaments, perforated plates, spores and amorphous forms. Their abundance differed little between facies. Some of the filamentous structures were probably post-depositional fungal hyphae utilizing carbon resources within the deposits. © Yorkshire Geological Society, 2008.},

	abstract = {This research forms the basis for the applicability of the Dunham (1962) classification of carbonated rock lithofacies to the analysis of the giant Ballık travertine architecture, while reconstructing lateral and vertical environmental changes. This study provides an analogue for spring-related deposits encountered offshore Brazil and Angola by linking macroscopically travertine lithofacies distribution to depositional environments. The analysis is based on rock-building constituents such as gastropods, charophytes, intraclasts, phytoclasts, coated grains, dendrites etc., forming micro-sedimentary fabrics with different structures such as packstone, grainstone, wackestone and boundstone, these latter closely associated with crust of dendrites and phytoherm of reeds and bryophytes. Our findings indicate that the Ballık travertine area consists of a “Lower” and an “Upper Domain” reflecting different depositional environments. More specifically, the “Lower Domain” consists from west to east of a laterally complex amalgamation of extended pool, marsh pool and flood plain environments that formed from a mixture of spring and ground waters. The extended pond environment characterised by a boundstone facies of stromatolites in the west evolves eastward into a marsh pool and flood plain. This is because CO2 degassing and water temperature decreased as the water depth of the Lower Domain reduced towards the east. The marsh pool environment includes packstone to grainstone lithofacies and abundant wackestone lithofacies made of phytoclasts, whose crusts exhibit pustular fabrics. Moreover, the flood plains along with the marsh pool consist dominantly of packstone to grainstone lithofacies with many gastropods and intraclasts, interfingered with wackestone lithofacies made of phytoclasts. Irregular clotted fabrics, along with coated grains with radial fibres, high lime mud content with bioturbation are also present. The “Upper Domain” displays a laterally less heterogeneous palaeoenvironmental distribution with flooded slope and flood plain deposits. The eastern part of the “Upper Domain” is characterized by a systematic alternation of these environments, with intercalations of wackstone lithofacies made of phytoclasts, packstone to grainstone lithofacies made of intraclasts and lime muds as well as coated grains. The flood plain has coated grains having peloidal nuclei and coatings of sparry laminations and clotted fabric of peloids representing intraclasts, whereas, the flooded slope possesses coated grains with coatings of dendrites and nuclei of peloids, boundstone of stromatolites which have flat-laminated and columnar-laminated fabrics indicating a laminar discharge away from the spring(s). Alluvial fan and palustrine deposits with abundant bryophytes and reeds frequently interfinger with marsh pool environment in the “Lower Domain”, and with the flood plain and flooded slope environments in the “Upper Domain”. The results illustrate well how environmental changes identified in the two different domains have induced heterogeneity in reservoir-based depositional architecture. © 2020 Association Francaise pour l'Etude du Quaternaire.

The studied biotic variables in spring habitats referred to diatoms (algae), mosses, vascular flora and benthic fauna. The species presence was controlled by both natural and anthropogenic factors. The results showed that the heterogeneity of diatoms, mosses and vascular flora of springs are mainly constrained by physical and chemical water parameters. Among other factors reflecting species requirements (including benthic fauna) in the springs were the mineralogical diversification of bottom sediment, discharge and flow velocity, physical and chemical water parameters and anthropopressure. The most natural springs were large outflows Centuria and Błękitne Źrodła. The springs Pióro and Łączki Kobylańskie are among the most anthropogenically modified springs. Various taxa such as postglacial relict Crenobia alpina were found in selected springs (Pilica-Piaski and Centuria).

They occur in high abundance and due to the feeding types they have strong influence on bacteria, algae, detritus and meiofauna in periphyton and sediments. The main aims of this study were to determine the vertical distribution of nematodes and their feeding types within the moss-covered tufa barrier over a one year period in Plitvice Lakes National Park. Altogether 23 taxa were identified with a maximum value of 198 ind. 10 cm-2 in spring. Stylet-bearing suction feeders were the dominant nematode feeding type in bryophytes and in the deeper layers of the tufa substrates. The domination of Adenophorea and the high value of the maturity index (MI) confirmed that this was clean, unpolluted water and showed the oligotrophic state of investigated habitat. The results demonstrated that nematodes, due to their high abundance and biomass, play an important role in karst water sediments.},

	abstract = {There are very few palaeoecological studies of thermal springs in central Europe, despite the fact that they are extreme but stable habitats that enabled the long-term survival of certain species and are located in areas for which there is little data about landscape history. In western Slovakia, close to Malé Bielice village at the northern margin of the Pannonian-Carpathian boundary, a peat-forming warm spring is uniquely preserved, and it still harbours a rare plant, Cladium mariscus. This site is located in a region that is noteworthy for the occurrence of many rare, light-demanding species that have disjunct distributions or are at the limits of their distributions, which may indicate a long history of treeless habitats there. The geographical position of this study site thus provides a great opportunity to address the perennial debate about in situ relicts and the continuity of grasslands throughout the forest optimum.We analysed a Holocene sediment core for macrofossils of vascular plants, bryophytes and molluscs, and for pollen, which were surprisingly preserved in rather high diversity, which enabled a detailed reconstruction of the landscape history.We further reviewed the archaeological evidence. Using this multi-proxy approach, we were able to confirm (i) the early expansion of mesophilous trees (Ulmus, Fraxinus, Tilia and Quercus) in northern parts of the Carpathian-Pannonian boundary, but the onset of this expansion could not be dated precisely, (ii) the continual persistence of the Cladium mariscus population in the fen, and (iii) existence of open steppes and/or dry grasslands and open wetlands in this region throughout the Holocene. Since the Bronze Age, there are coincidences in the history of human settlement, local development of the fen and regional changes in the representation of particular habitats, including managed wet, mesic and semi-dry grasslands.},

	abstract = {The Fall Creek Tufa is a relict, mid- to late-Holocene freshwater carbonate spring deposit that is formed almost entirely of calcite-encased Cratoneuron commutatum gametophytes. The spring is presently active, emitting 13 °C meteorically derived waters, but it is not precipitating calcite. Wood embedded in the youngest part of the tufa yielded a radiocarbon (14C) date of 310 ± 50 years BP. The oldest parts of the deposit could not be dated by radiocarbon methods because of a lack of embedded organics. The Fall Creek Tufa, however, probably began forming ∼5000 years BP in response to the same wet climatic conditions that initiated calcite precipitation at Miette Hot Springs in Jasper National Park and the Cave and Basin Hot Springs in Banff National Park. The relict deposit is composed largely of calcite cements that were precipitated around the bryophytes, with lesser amounts of internal sediments. The tufa formed through a repeated four-stage developmental process that involved (I) encrustation, (II) encapsulation, (III) cavity occlusion, and (IV) diagenetic alteration. These stages were temporally and spatially variable. Although a young deposit, much of it has undergone extensive aggrading recrystallization, whereby crystal size has increased as adjacent calcite crystals were sutured together. Epifluorescence microscopy shows that primary depositional fabrics were masked, but not destroyed, during recrystallization. Narrow ranges of δ18O (VPDB, Vienna Pee-Dee Belemnite standard) values (- 18.4‰ to - 17.7‰) and δ13C (VPDB) values (- 1.2‰ to 0.5‰) indicate that the calcite was in isotopic equilibrium with the water that it precipitated from, and that diagenesis did not reset the stable oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions. © 2007 NRC Canada.},

The springs under study differed from other coastal and inland examples of this type of habitat in relation to the abiotic factors controlling their distribution and also some botanical traits. They are the southernmost petrifying springs reported to date on the Atlantic coast of Europe.

	abstract = {The relict Holocene Hot Creek carbonate spring deposit in southeast British Columbia is characterized by excellent preservation of soft-tissue organisms (e.g. cyanobacteria), but poor preservation of organisms with hard-tissue (e.g. wood, diatoms). The deposit is formed mainly of calcified cyanobacteria, with fewer mineralized macrophytes (plants), bryophytes (mosses), wood, and diatoms. Cyanobacteria grew as solitary filaments (Lyngbya) and as radiating hemispherical colonies (Rivularia). Both were preserved by encrustation and encapsulation while alive, and as casts after filament death and decay. Sheath impregnation was rare to absent. Filament encrustation, whereby calcite crystals nucleated on, and grew away from the sheath exterior, produced moulds that replicated external filament morphology, but hastened filament decay. Filament encapsulation, whereby calcite nucleated in the vicinity of, and grew towards the encapsulated filament, promoted sheath preservation even after trichome decay. Subsequent calcite precipitation inside the hollow sheath generated sheath casts. The inability of mineralizing spring water to penetrate durable cell walls meant that bryophytes, macrophytes, and most wood was preserved by encrustation. Some wood resisted complete decay for several thousand years, and its lignified cell walls allowed rare permineralizations. Diatoms were not preserved in the relict deposit because the frustules were dissolved by the basic spring water. Amorphous calcium carbonate produced by photosynthetic CO2 removal may have acted as nucleation sites for physicochemically precipitated calcite. Thus, metabolic activities of floral organisms probably initiated biotic mineralization, but continuous inorganic calcite precipitation on and in flora ensured that soft tissues were preserved. © 2010.},

	abstract = {Stratigraphic and sedimentological analyses of the Quaternary tufa and associated deposits in the Piedra and Mesa river valleys allowed a number of stages of their sedimentary evolution to be characterized, and a depositional sedimentary model for this north-central sector of the Iberian Range (Spain) to be established. The proposed sedimentary facies model may explain tufa arrangements in other medium to high gradient, stepped, fluvial tufa systems with narrow transverse profiles occurring in temperate, semi-arid areas, in both recent and past scenarios. There are several tufa deposits within the Piedra and Mesa river valleys that, over a maximum thickness of about 90m, record one or more stages of tufa deposition produced following the fluvial incision of the bedrock or previous tufa deposits. Each depositional stage begins with coarse detrital sedimentation. Six fundamental, vertical sequences of tufa facies with small amounts of detrital material reveal the sedimentary processes that occurred in different fluvial environments: channel areas with: (i) free-flowing water; (ii) barrages and/or cascades; and (iii) dammed water and palustrine floodplains. The proposed sedimentary model involves narrow, stepped, fluvial valleys in which tufa cascades were common. Alternating intervals of bryophyte and stromatolite facies commonly formed at some cascades. Many of these represented barrage-cascade structures that consisted of phytoclast rudstones, thick phytoherms of mosses and associated stromatolites, and curtain-shaped phytoherms of stems. Upstream of these structures, dammed areas with bioclastic sands and silts developed and palustrine vegetation grew. The channel stretches between barrages and/or cascades were loci for extensive stromatolite growth in fast flowing water. The palustrine floodplain was home to pools and drainage channels. The model also explains the growth of some barrages in the River Piedra that surpassed the height of the divide, with the diffluence of the main channel into a secondary course forming other tufa deposits in the area. The distribution and abundance of certain types of tufa facies in fluvial basins may be an indicator of differences in their gradients. The facies studied in this work suggest that the gradient of the ancient River Piedra was steeper than that of the ancient River Mesa. Assuming similar scenarios for climate and hydrology, the depositional settings mentioned above and their dimensions would have been determined mainly by the gradient and width of the associated river valleys. This sedimentary model may also be useful for inferring variations in other river basin slopes, as well as accounting for the presence of tufas in areas that normally have no permanent water input. © 2011 The Authors.

Such needs are much more urgent in karst aquatic ecosystems where spectacular natural scenic wonders attract millions of visitors to natural areas with streams and lakes that are particularly vulnerable to nutrient pollution. To identify a set of biotic indicators of phosphorus (P) pollution in a karst stream, we conducted an in situ P enrichment experiment in a nearly pristine karst stream located at a UNESCO world heritage site in China. Our results show that both benthic algal assemblages and macroinvertebrates were sensitive to P enrichment. Changes in diatoms (e.g., Achnanthidium minutissimum, Delicata delicatula) and macroinvertebrates (e.g., collectors) were indicative of P enrichment. The color change of travertine bryophyte beds from creamy white to green was largely due to increase in filamentous green algae such as Zygnema sp., which may provide a visual cue for P enrichment and pollution. Our findings, in conjunction with further studies that directly link these indicators with human disturbance (e.g., tourist activities) throughout the park, could improve the operation of park managers in minimizing tourist-induced nutrient pollution and in operationalizing these indicators in the current environmental monitoring and assessment program. © 2016},

The aims of the study were to identify dragonfly composition, abundance and spatial distribution, their habitat and microhabitat preferences, and to determine the most important environmental factors explaining dragonfly assemblages in the studied hydrosystem. The dragonfly fauna was composed of eight species, Onychogomphus forcipatus (Linnaeus, 1758) was the most widespread and the most numerous. Water temperature, ammonium and oxygen concentrations had the highest influence on dragonfly assemblages. The most favorable habitat type were tufa barriers, less favorable were lower lotic habitats, while dragonflies were almost completely absent from upper lotic habitats and their springs. Dragonfly larvae preferred microhabitats with inorganic substrates (i.e. cobbles and sand) and slower water velocity, while they mostly avoided mosses associated with the strongest current.

	abstract = {The travertine formation process, active over the Quaternary, has enabled the origin of one of the largest travertine accumulations in the Western Carpathians. Travertines and calcareous tufas are associated with the tectonic activity of the Central Slovak Fault System, a 45 km wide and 140 km long N-S oriented fault zone. As the geological mapping, structural analysis, geomorphometric and isobase surface analysis revealed, the development of faults was polyphase and the travertine/tufa precipitation was not a continuous process. In addition, numerous travertine/tufa morphofacial varieties have been recognized within the study area, such as travertine/tufa terraces and tufa cascades, hillslope paludal tufa crust, phytoherm framework tufa barrages, lacustrine microdetrital tufas, bryophyte-dominated self-built channel, and fluvial tufa crust, reflecting its local geomorphology and precipitation factors. In the Revúcka dolina Valley, the travertine/tufa geobodies thus represent a reliable indicator of the tectonic activity over the Neogene up to Quaternary. The structural data provided relevant evidence confirming the character of orogen-parallel extension for the current tectonic/neotectonic regime in the Inner Western Carpathians. High-resolution topography derived from airborne laser scanning and the subsequent application of various geomorphometry techniques allowed quick identification of the edges of the terrace cascade systems and morpholineaments. Based on our observations, in this zone, the significant vertical movements of normal faults took place with a maximum estimated offset of 800–1000 m. The achieved results also support the use of the presented multifaceted methodology to understand the interplay between geomorphogenesis, hydrology, and tectonics. © 2024},

	abstract = {The Pleistocene Tortajada fluvial deposit occurs in the eastern active margin of the Teruel Basin. It developed in the early stages of opening of the basin and at present is disconnected to the Alfambra River. The preserved deposits show that the fluvial system consisted in three different sub-environments including: Upper Terraces, Ponds and Cascades. The main facies are framestones of stems, phytoclastic rudstone, framestone of bryophytes, peloidal and filamentous stromatolites, mudstone and detrital (conglomerates and slope-breccias) facies. These facies are arranged in three different sequence types, all of them showing a lower detrital term followed by pond and, in cases, cascade deposits. The microfacies analyses reveal that both biotic and abiotic processes performed an important role in the deposition within the river. Isotopic analyses (δ18O from -8.58‰ to -6.70‰ VPDB and δ13C from -7.44‰ to -3.97‰ VPDB) are indicative of meteoric water within a hydrologically open system. The carbonate hinterland rocks, together with a semi-arid to sub-humid climate favored carbonate accumulation within the river.Our results point out that the location, morphology and sedimentary sequences of the Tortajada fluvial system had an important tectonic control. The situation of the main and secondary faults controlled the paleomorphology of the river floor. Thus cascades are found in areas of important step faults, whereas the spaces between faults were occupied by fluviatile/lacustrine areas. In addition the development of the different sedimentary sequences was also a reflection of movements of these faults. In short, our study may confirm that tectonism is an important control on tufa development. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Research on the microbiology of cave environments and biologically mediated freshwater calcium carbonate deposits has been active in the past few decades. Among these deposits, tufaceous stalactites are common in tropical cave entrances and limestone cliffs. Their soft porous texture, irregular bulbous and generally positive phototropic morphologies reflect biological influences, principally those of cyanobacteria, algae and mosses. Despite the abundance of tufaceous stalactites, tufaceous stalagmites have rarely been documented and biologically mediated stalagmites have been reported only in a few locations worldwide. Four unusual elongated tufaceous stalagmites in the entrance passage of Temple Cave at Batu Caves (Selangor, Malaysia) are reported here. Their location, morphology and features indicate constructive and destructive biological influences. Some of their features resemble those of crayback stalagmites suggesting that similar processes played a role in their formation. Other features, such as prograding noses, macro-porosity, and internal stalactites, resemble those observed in non-spelean biologically mediated calcium carbonate deposits like tufa waterfalls. One of the stalagmites also has small scale erosive microrelief, including striations and rods. These are oriented parallel to incoming light from the cave entrance and are identified as photokarren, a particular and rare form of biokarst. This is the first published record of photokarren in a West Malaysian cave. The morphology of biologically influenced stalagmites is found to be more varied than previously thought and they are not particularly rare, but may have gone unrecognized in many tropical cave entrances. A conceptual model of asymmetrical stalagmite growth is presented with abiotic and biotic factors. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Research was conducted on the barrage-lake system of the Plitvice Lakes, Croatia. Four layers were distinguished within the substrate (moss mat + three travertine layers) in three hydraulic habitats at three sites. Substrate samples were collected monthly with a core sampler. The aim of the study was to explore the ability of moss mats and travertine substrate to accumulate POM; to ascertain the role of flow velocity and to produce a model of POM distribution pattern. The average of POM deposited in the 10 cm deep zone decreased significantly in the three sites along longitudinal profile of the system. Most POM was deposited in the moss mats, and the amounts decreased exponentially with depth. This was observed for coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM), ultra-fine particulate organic matter (UPOM) and total organic matter (TPOM) while fine organic matter (FPOM) deposition appeared unaffected by depth. More POM was accumulated in hydraulic habitats of low flow velocity. Correlation between flow velocity and POM accumulation was generally negative. Positive correlations between flow velocity and deposition rates were noted for CPOM in moss mats and top travertine layers; the deposition of other POM fractions was negatively influenced by the flow velocity. The influence of flow velocity decreased with increasing depth. In the deepest layers (7-10 cm) flow velocity influenced only the deposition of the smallest particles (UPOM). © Springer 2005.},

	abstract = {The transfer of diaspore-containing hay from ancient grasslands is a suitable method for the restoration of species-rich grasslands on former arable land. Some target species, however, such as early flowering and procumbent species cannot be transferred by this method. Against this background the investigation aimed to study the effects of sowing and planting as restoration methods, which can be used Jn addition to hay transfer. The study was carried out on four calcareous grassland species, Anthericum ramosum, Globularia cordifolia, Pulsatilla patens and Scabiosa canescens, on ex-arable fields with and without topsoil removal. Investigations included the effects of diverging site conditions (with or without topsoil removal) and of different methods of introduction (autumn sowing, autumn planting, s_pring planting) on species establishment from 2004 to 2006. Fot all species, planting was more successful than sowing. Germination rates in the field were always lower than 10% and Globularia cordifolia hardly germinated at all. On a topsoil removal site, where calcareous grasslands had been established by hay transfer in 1993, removal of litter and mosses by raking before sowing led to a higher germination rate and to a better seedling establishment than on control plots without raking. Individuals of Pulsatilla patens, planted in autumn, developed significantly better on all sites than individuals planted in spring. Plant survival of the three other species was not influenced by time of planting, but topsoil removal had a significantly positive effect on species establishment. A final analysis of costs and benefits indicated that inexpensive sowing can be recommended for the introduction of Anthericum ramosum, Pulsatilla patens and Scabiosa canescens, and is most promising after removal of the topsoil. Planting is much more expensive and can be advised only for species like Globularia cordifolia, which can hardly be established by seeds.},

	abstract = {Accurate determination of the tufa growth rate (TGR) is required to answer the fundamental geomorphological question of tufa evolution. The TGR has been measured by various direct and indirect methods. One of the most popular direct methods uses modified micro-erosion meter (MEM), which has several drawbacks. Here, we present for the first time a coordinate measuring macro-photogrammetry device (CMD) for monitoring the TGR in a contactless manner. The CMD was applied on 28 limestone plates at 14 locations within the Skradinski buk area, Croatia, and measurements were performed in the laboratory. The TGR was derived from digital tufa high-resolution models (DTHRMs). The accuracy of the device was evaluated using state-of-the-art three-dimensional (3D) scanners and error calculation at checkpoints. Moreover, the precision was evaluated with the split test (n = 5). A total of 74 DTHRMs with a spatial resolution of 0.0236 mm were created. The TGR ranged from 0.327 to 19.302 mm a−1, with an average of 5.771 mm a−1. A higher TGR was observed on the limestone plates near mosses, located in fast and turbulent water rather than in stagnant water. We found that specific micro-environmental factors (e.g. proximity to moss) positively affected tufa growth. Erosion events were observed, as well as the presence of aquatic insect larvae (Simuliidae and Chironomidae), which positively affected tufa growth. The CMD is a precise and accurate device that does not suffer from the drawbacks of the MEM method and has many other advantages. It has a high capability of tufa erosion detection, enables the identification of macroinvertebrates, and multispectral or hyperspectral cameras can be mounted on the device for spectral reflectance analysis of the tufa surface. The CMD can be applied in any study requiring a sub-millimetre data quality and involving the comparison of consecutive 3D models and derivation of various parameters of smaller objects. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

This landscape provides a good opportunity for studying the relationship between patch size and plant species numbers at small scale. To gain basic understanding of the plant diversity pattern and improve our ability to conserve the rich biodiversity in Huanglong valley, we sampled a total of 122 patches, and analyzed the patch size species relationships using multiple regression and power formulation. Our study showed that patch size correlated strongly with species richness. Specifically, large patch had more number of species comparing to small ones. Other ecological factors, i. e. the depth of soil, the moss coverage of the patch and the distance among patches, had no correlation on species richness of patches. However, the distance of the patch to the edge of forest, along with patch size, correlated significantly with orchid species numbers. The relationship between species richness and areas were consistent with the power formulation S = cAz. The Z values were different with various patch size. The medium patch size (1 -10 m2) had the largest Z value (0.2616), followed by the smallest patch size (S < 1 m2, Z =0. 2382), and the largest patch size had the lowest Z values (S = 10 - 100 m2, Z = 0. 2050). These results indicated that the medium patch size had the highest increase rate on species number accumulation, whereas the largest patch size had the lowest increase rate.},

	abstract = {The Late Pleistocene travertine outcrops from Deir Alla, Suwayma, and Az Zara were investigated, and their microfacies were identified. The microfacies of the Deir Alla travertines include micrite and spar groundmass, shrubs, crystalline crusts, a stromatolite-like structure, peloids, and cements. Shrub travertine includes spar calcite-coated stems with probably microbial micritic clumps. The crystalline crust travertine displays an alternation of micrite and sparite laminae. The micritic laminae are dark-coloured. Bundles of radial spar crystals are associated locally with micritic groundmass. The crystalline crust developed where biogenic activity is limited. Peloidal microfacies are less than 0.25 mm in diameter, cryptocrystalline, pale-dark green in colour, elliptical to spherical in shape, and usually associated with microorganisms. The microfacies of the Suwayma and Az Zara travertines include crystalline calcite rhombs and other composite scalenohedral crystals. They occur as small anhedral-subhedral crystals, monocrystalline to some polycrystalline, corroded, subrounded, and mainly coated with iron oxide and/or clay minerals. Peloids, ooids, and oncoids are common. They are dark-green coloured, cryptocrystalline to microcrystalline carbonates of spherical and ellipsoidal shape with less than 1 mm in diameter. Rich flora travertines include reed and paper-thin rafts with leaf impressions encrusted on moss cushions. The flora observed in the upper part of the Suwayma section was identified as charophyte oospores (gyrogonites). A few grains of quartz are present as small subhedral-euhedral crystals, monocrystalline, corroded, rounded, and mainly coated with iron oxide. The iron is irregularly distributed among the laminae and voids and is occasionally replaced by carbonates. The described macrophyte encrustation structures probably represent algae, cyanobacteria, or bryophytes. All samples of micrite and spar calcite appear as groundmass. © 2022 Malaysian Abstracting and Indexing System. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Calc tufa associated with waterfalls and rapids from Ane Ghat in the western Deccan Traps have been studied on the basis of their field occurrence, morphology and microtextures. The calc tufas are semi-consolidated and show porous, spongy morphology and occasionally ‘soda straw’ structure. Blue green algae, moss and diatoms are the predominant biotic components of the calc tufa. The growth of such calcifying biota has played a constructive role in building calc tufa deposits at Ane Ghat. Mineralogically, the tufas are made of calcite and contain variable carbonate percentage (53 to 78%). Petrographically, they contain fragments of basalt, devitrified glass, plagioclase, quartz, agate, zeolites, etc. set in a clay-rich and clay-poor micrite. Irregular pore spaces and voids are partially filled with spary calcite lined by thin layers of clay. SEM images of pristine calc tuffa surfaces reveal micromorphological and textural features that dominantly reflect precipitation. Images of insoluble residue of phases like glass, plagioclase and zeolites indicate some dissolution and corrosive features indicating post depositional diagenetic processes. δ18O V-SMOW values range from 27.03 to 28.92‰ and δ13C V-PDB values of −3.58 to −6.02‰ are recorded for the Ane Ghat samples. The calc tufas were precipitated from waters at paleotemperatures of 16.3 to 27.1°C. The calc tufa from Ane Ghat represents biological and physico-chemical calcification processes in response to variability in calcium carbonate saturation and water chemistry in temperate to semi-arid climate. © 2019, GEOL.

	abstract = {Holocene tufas of Orissa State, India, are formed in stream / fluvial environments. Sparry and micritic laminae in stromatolitic tufa represent seasonal deposition and contain cyanobacteria and diatoms. Micropores in spar crystals suggest bacterial activity. Aragonitic laminae show radial, bushy, and spherulitic fabrics which may be microbially controlled. Phytohermal (moss-rich) tufas show micritic to microsparry encrustations and reveal epiphytic microorganisms. CO2 degassing due to agitation from waters supersaturated with respect to calcite, is the dominant process of precipitation. Aragonite precipitation is possibly controlled by Sr concentrations in the waters. Pisoids have been formed by alternate disposition of micritic and microsparry laminae and sediment-rich zones around intraclastic tufa. Vadoids show development of fine cortical laminae around spherulites and radial needles. Microfabric of speleothem-like crusts suggest precipitation of finer crystallites and their subsequent transformation to a coarser fabric. Rhombic, needle and spike-like cements and neomorphic spar (inverted from aragonite) are developed in a vadose setting. Aragonite to calcite inversion is supported by texture-chemistry variance. The tufas have been formed in three depositional environments (1) waterfall environment, (2) slope environment and (3) river channel margin environment.},

	abstract = {Meiobenthic fauna is complex and essential part of the stream benthos and it is known as intermediaries from bacteria to higher trophic levels. However, the dynamics and mechanisms regulating this community at small-scale largely have been neglected. This study was carried out to determine meiofaunal dynamics in a small scale-patterns influenced by flow velocity and other abiotic and biotic factors. We examined meiofauna within bryophytes on a tufa barrier in Plitvice Lakes National Park using a detailed taxonomic approach of various meiofaunal groups and their feeding guilds. We choose three microhabitats (slow, medium, fast) differing significantly in flow velocity above bryophytes. Bdelloid rotifers were the most abundant group in microhabitat with highest flow velocity, while in other two microhabitats nematodes and monogonont rotifers prevailed in abundance. Data on environmental variables and main meiofaunal taxa and feeding guilds were analyzed using redundancy analysis. This analysis indicated that microfilter feeding guild (e.g. bdelloid rotifers) was strongly affected by interaction of flow velocity and POM fractions. Other feeding guilds were influenced by temperature, oxygen and/or pH and did not prefer high flow velocity. Suction-feeder nematodes and microfilter-feeder rotifers were dominant on temporal and spatial scale, indicating their good adaptations on frequently disturbed conditions that prevailed on bryophyte covered tufa barrier. Our results provide comprehensive survey of diversity, density as well as trophic structure of meiofauna in aquatic bryophytes. Differences in meiofaunal composition and density between three microhabitats suggest that the meiofauna is relevant indicator of environmental changes even at small-scale pattern. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

	abstract = {Most recent ecological studies of testate amoebae were conducted in acid Sphagnum-dominated mires. Little data exists about the variation in testacean assemblages along the complete gradient from extremely poor acid fens to strongly calcareous spring fens. This so called poor-rich gradient is the most important gradient for the majority of mire biota and can display a time dimension as well. In order to fill this gap we studied modern testacean assemblages in spring fens in the Western Carpathians (Czech Republic and Slovakia). The DCA of all testacean assemblages revealed two major factors controlling species variation, the poor-rich gradient and the microhabitat-type: waterlogged bare sediments versus bryophytes. Sampled sediments of poor acidic fens have species composition similar to that of bryophyte tufts from mineral-richer fens. The ordination of the subset of samples taken from bryophyte tufts shows the clear poor-rich gradient on the first axis and moisture gradient causing variation of "acid" samples along the second axis. Based of DCA results, testacean assemblages were divided into six major types for which the diagnostic species were determined using phi-coefficient. Nearly all types are dominated by Euglyphidae, Centropyxidae, Cyclopyxidae and Difflugiidae were characteristic for calcareous habitats. Species richness did not correlate with the poor-rich gradient. The species variation in testate amoebae assemblages is better predicted by both the species composition of the vegetation as a whole and by the composition of bryophyte tuft than by long-term averages of water chemistry variables. The autecology of many species living in acid Sphagnum fens corresponds well with published data with several exceptions. On the other hand, the study of the complete poor-rich gradient revealed different species optima reported from higher pH Sphagnum fens, and thus it changed our view on the indicative value of some species.},

	abstract = {Extensive palustrine tufa deposits are not common in the geological record, in part due to their liability to erosion. This work discusses the formation and preservation factors that allow the wide development of such facies, taking the example of a Middle-Late Pleistocene dominantly palustrine area that formed downstream of a high-slope stepped tufa fluvial stretch, in the Ebrón river Valley (south Iberian Range). The study case (Los Santos area) consists of coarse detrital sediments at the base, associated with pronounced incisions on the underlying deposits, followed by a variety of tufa and associated carbonate facies, with a minimum thickness of 19 m. The most abundant facies are the phytoclastic rudstones, carbonate sands and silts with gastropods and ostracods and up-growing stem boundstones. Less common are moss boundstones, down-growing stem boundstones and bioclastic limestones. Up to five simple vertical sequences of facies (facies associations) are characterized. The sedimentary facies model corresponds to a low-slope and wide stretch at the end of a stepped, cascade-barrage fluvial system, with extensive palustrine areas, shallow ponded areas, at places with stagnant conditions, and small cascades. Variations of bedrock lithology, from Mesozoic carbonate rocks upstream to Neogene alluvial rocks downstream, allowed the gentle sloping and wide low-layering surface at the distal termination of the fluvial system, with overall low-energy facies, which supports the absence of stromatolites. Indeed, the lack of vigorous erosional processes enabled a dense cover of hydrophilous plants to thrive on diverse environments and the accumulation and preservation of organic matter. The small thickness of the studied deposits, compared to that of upstream deposits, is consistent with a reduction of dissolved calcium and bicarbonate contents downstream (linked to the distal position from the carbonate aquifer sourced springs), and with the diminishing mechanical CO2-degassing in low-gradient environments. © 2021 CSIC.},

	abstract = {The Jiuzhaigou National Nature Reserve on the Tibetan Plateau (Sichuan, southwestern China) is characterized by the deposition of fluvial travertine in a spectacular array of shoals, waterfalls, pool dams, and multicolored lakes. This is possibly the highest vegetated travertine setting of the world, from 2200 to 2900 m above sea level, an environment sensitive to minimal changes in temperature and precipitation regime. The evolution of the system is driven by two seasonal monsoon climate patterns with a wet spring-summer travertine deposition and then a dry fall-winter characterized by no precipitation or erosion. Spring and phreatic-vadose deposits transition from laminated columnar calcite to clotted micrite encrustation, possibly correlated with a mid-Holocene peak in precipitation and high lake levels in the northeastern Tibetan area connected to glacial advance. The most peculiar features are the fluvial shoals, a rather uncommon travertine surface consisting of two main superimposed facies of alternating weak- and strong-turbulence water flow. The low-turbulence facies consists of clotted micrite encrustation of mosses and cyanobacteria filaments, and platy calcite crystals covering algal filaments. The high-water-turbulence facies show seasonal alternation of diatom-rich bundles of Phormidium sp. (late spring) with algal Oocardium stratum levels (summer-fall). Upslope and downslope of the shoals, the precipitation of calcium carbonate results in the formation of prograding waterfalls and dam-pool systems that encrust macrophytes with microspar and clotted micrite. Encrusted chironomids larvae tubes are present in the waterfall walls up to an elevation of 2860 m, possibly the highest ever recorded. Early diagenetic processes such as dissolution of diatom frustules take place over the span of several years, a slower phenomenon compared to other travertine occurrences. In this high-elevation extreme setting, travertine sand and gravel bar deposits are produced by the exposure to severe weathering of a section of the valley that is bypassed through an underground karst system during the winter dry season. High-elevation travertine probably has a low preservation potential, but it appears to be more sensitive to climate changes than other depositional settings, especially in the Himalayan-Tibetan area, where the extent of the Quaternary glacial advances and retreats is still a matter of debate. © 2017, SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).},

	abstract = {Climate warming and associated environmental changes lead to compositional shifts and local extinctions in various ecosystems. Species closely associated with rare island-like habitats such as groundwater-dependent spring fens can be severely threatened by these changes due to a limited possibility to disperse. It is, however, largely unknown to what extent mesoclimate affects species composition in spring fens, where microclimate is buffered by groundwater supply. We assembled an original landscape-scale dataset on species composition of the most waterlogged parts of isolated temperate spring fens in the Western Carpathian Mountains along with continuously measured water temperature and hydrological, hydrochemical, and climatic conditions. We explored a set of hypotheses about the effects of mesoclimate air and local spring-water temperature on compositional variation of aquatic (macroinvertebrates), semi-terrestrial (plants) and terrestrial (land snails) components of spring-fen biota, categorized as habitat specialists and other species (i.e. matrix-derived). Water temperature did not show a high level of correlation with mesoclimate. For all components, fractions of compositional variation constrained to temperature were statistically significant and higher for habitat specialists than for other species. The importance of air temperature at the expense of water temperature and its fluctuation clearly increased with terrestriality, i.e. from aquatic macroinvertebrates via vegetation (bryophytes and vascular plants) to land snails, with January air temperature being the most important factor for land snails and plant specialists. Some calcareous-fen specialists with a clear distribution centre in temperate Europe showed a strong affinity to climatically cold sites in our study area and may hence be considered as threatened by climate warming. We conclude that prediction models solely based on air temperature may provide biased estimates of future changes in spring fen communities, because their aquatic and semiterrestrial components are largely affected by water temperature that is modified by local hydrological and landscape settings. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In the Quaternary Sarıkavak fluvial tufa deposits, situated in south-western Turkey, different facies have been identified and their mutual relationships have been unravelled. This tufa formation is located at the northern part of Acıgöl Graben. The development of the Sarıkavak tufas represents typical fluvial and fluvio-palustrine environments. In total eight tufa lithofacies have been differentiated, namely: moss tufa facies, oncolitic tufa facies, stromatolitic tufa facies, phytoclastic tufa facies, intraclastic tufa facies, extra-formational clastic tufa facies, sapropelitic tufa facies, and palaeosol. Preliminary U/Th datings indicate that these deposits formed prior to 219 ka and continued until 80 ka (MIS 7 till 5). δ13C signatures (0.78‰ to −1.63‰ V-PDB) best can be explained by limestone dissolution processes or respiration from C4 plant vegetation into the soil or both. For that reason, the Sarıkavak tufa deposits can be classified as ‘travitufa’ which precipitated in a distal facies system of travertine occurrences. δ18O values (−7.49‰ to −10.83‰ V-PDB) of the whole data set reflect some significant changes, which is interpreted in terms of temperature variations reflecting warm and cold periods among MIS 7 (interglacial), MIS 6 (glacial) and MIS 5 (interglacial). The development of the Sarıkavak tufa deposits are related to the Maymundağı fault that borders the Acıgöl Graben in the north. This fault and its synthetic fault segments play a pivotal role with regard to the palaeo-flow direction of water and control the basin topography. These structural structures are likely responsible for all active and ancient springs in the study area, as well as their respective carbonate precipitates. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA},

The tufas from Bonito region, Brazil, occur mostly along rivers and creeks in a karstic system of the Corumba Group. These deposits are included in the Serra da Bodoquena Formation. This work aims: 1) understand the physical and chemical conditions of the fluid; 2) identify the depositional environment; 3) correlate isotopic and palynological data to paleoclimatic studies. Petrographic descriptions, XRD, XRF and stable isotopes analyzes were carried out, besides palynological studies. The samples were systematically collected in an outcrop at Mimosa site, Rio Formoso Member. Three lithofacies were defined at Bonito tufas: I) phytoherm, formed by the accumulation of leaves, branch fragments and bryophytes cushions; ii) shrubs composed by radii-fibers structures; and, iii) stromatolites, laminated forms. All the facies were correlated to pools, barriers and cascade or waterfalls, as the depositional context. The negative trend of the isotopic data revealed a meteoric fluid and biological influence on the precipitation. The presence of fungi and hyphae, pteridophytes spores and angiosperms pollen indicate a humid ambient with large vegetation, typical of tropical conditions. © 2018, Universidade Estadual Paulista.

	abstract = {Sedimentological and hydrochemical parameters of the River Piedra (north-east Spain) were monitored every six months (from 1999 to 2012) at 24 sites, at which tablets were installed all along the river. The river water is of HCO3-SO4-Ca type and is notably influenced by inputs from upstream karstic springs. Tufa deposition was first detected 8 km downstream of these springs and greatly increased from there, primarily along the steeper stretch (i.e. within the Monasterio de Piedra Natural Park); then, deposition decreased through the most downstream stretch, with smaller ground water inputs. The spatial evolution of the tufa thickness, with parallel variations of PWP (Plummer, Wigley, Parkhurst) rates, was thus determined by the river water pCO2 which was controlled by ground water inputs and by the river bed slope. Five fluvial subenvironments and seven sedimentary facies were characterized. The water flow conditions are the primary factor responsible for the distinct deposition rates of facies, mainly through CO2-outgassing. Stromatolites and moss-tufa and alga-tufa had the highest rates, whereas loose tufa formed in slow-flowing water and tufa of spray areas had thinner deposition. A six-month pattern in the deposition rate was detected through thickness measurements. That pattern was parallel to the seasonal PWP rates. The increased deposition during warm periods (spring and summer; mean: 5·08 mm) compared with cool periods (autumn and winter; mean: 2·77 mm) is linked chiefly to temperature, which controlled the seasonal changes in the physico-chemical and biological processes; this finding is supported by a principal components analysis. Seasonal variations of insolation and day duration also contributed to such a deposition pattern. Large discharge events, which provoked erosion of tufa deposits and dilution of water, caused the reversal of the seasonal deposition rate pattern. Stromatolites are likely to preserve the most complete sedimentary record. Although tufas are a potentially sensitive record of climate-related parameters, erosion is an intrinsic process that may overwhelm the effects of such parameters. This issue should be considered in palaeoclimatic studies based on the tufa record, particularly in semi-arid conditions. © 2013 International Association of Sedimentologists.},

	abstract = {Karstic tufa from the Brazilian semi-arid zone offers a key opportunity to study the depositional evolution, unveiling the past climate history with examples generated outside of the phreatic zone. Morpho-petrological identification, in addition to a structural survey, petrographic analysis, X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), and measurements of δ18O and δ13C, provided elements to explain the occurrence of tufa associated with a fracture system. Three sedimentary facies were identified, one allochthonous (detrital) and two autochthonous (in situ). Field recognition and structural analysis showed that tufa occurs only in the deformed portion of the Crato Formation, at the Triunfo Fault splay sector. Facies formed in an open fracture-controlled hydrological system during rainfall periods. The infiltration of meteoric water into the limestones of the Crato Formation facilitated the dissolution of the parent rock through time, with the percolation controlled by open fractures in tilted blocks. Breccia tufa developed in the early stage of the karstification by carbonate clast forming from the limestone, previously collapsed from the walls and later cemented by percolation of solutions enriched in calcium carbonate within fractures. The two autochthonous facies developed in later stages through continuous percolation of water, rock dissolution, bryophyte-microbial growth, soil development, and calcium carbonate precipitation in progressively more humid conditions. Thin section analyses and SEM imaging revealed calcite crystals closely related with organic structures. The association between tufa and microbial filamentous organisms (likely cyanobacteria) indicates an active biogenic role for the tufa origin. Calcite stable-isotopes analyses indicated tufa as a product of meteoric water as supported by δ18O isotope. Changes of the carbon ratios through time indicated influence of soil development and probably C3–C4 photosynthetic activity. An integrated structural, sedimentological, petrological, and geochemical approach provided elements to define these tufa deposits as formed in a fracture-system fed by meteoric water, as result of the post-Mesozoic denudation process that affected the Araripe Basin. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Microbially mediated calcification is a major process of carbonate production, yet little is known about eukaryotic microalgal calcifiers. We describe calcification and propagation of the unicellular microalga Oocardium stratum in an Alpine spring stream. The spring sheds Ca–Mg–HCO3 water with a temperature of 8–11 °C. The biota is dominated by O. stratum and diatoms; mosses, cyanobacteria, and filamentous eukaryotic algae are accessories. O. stratum colonize various substrates within the stream throughout the year. When colonizing, single cells attached to mucilage, then induced precipitation of a rim of calcite, and underwent a first division. A mature clone of O. stratum typically consists of single cells each housed within a calcite tube precipitated by the microalga. Upon cell division, the tubes branch, too, under retention of the optical orientation of the calcite. Continued growth, cell division, and calcification result in laminae of Oocardium calcite (OC) concordant with substrate shape. O. stratum accelerates but seems not to control calcite precipitation. A maximum vertical calcification rate of 5 mm/a was documented for a site ~ 25 m downstream of the spring. ‘Crystal-skeletal’ OC characterized low calcite supersaturation, whereas higher supersaturation corresponded with rhombohedral OC. Abiotic precipitation downward of the upper tips of growing calcite tubes resulted in compact spar crystals, irrespective of initial crystal habit. Diatoms that thrived on OC benefit from a large differentiated habitat. Our study confirms previous works that identify O. stratum, not cyanobacteria, as major biocalcifiers in some hardwater springs. Diagenetically mature Oocardium tufa, however, may be confused with spring limestones of other origins. © 2019, The Author(s).},

The study was carried out in Plitvice Lakes National Park (Dinaric karst region, Croatia) at outlets of three barrage lakes. On each site several microhabitats, which differ in substrate and water velocity were selected. The selected substrates were moss on tufa, particulate tufa with detritus, pebbles and silt. Sampling of dipteran adults was conducted at the end of every month during 2007/2008 with 6 emergence traps placed at each site. Simuliidae and Chironomidae were the most abundant families among the 13 families present. Temperature influenced the start of emergence and the duration of flight period. All three lake outlets differed in abundance of individuals, especially the lowest barrage lake outlet which can be contributed to the lowest levels of organic seston and highest rates of tufa deposition. For Chironomidae, Simuliidae and aquatic Empididae statistically significant positive correlation between abundance and current velocity was observed. The least favoured substrate for all Diptera families was silt, while moss was the preferred one.},

	abstract = {Macroinvrtebrate drift and streambed material transport are very important for the redistribution of energy sources and habitat-building elements within lotic ecosystems. The objective of the present study was to examine seasonal drift-benthos trends of macroinvertebrates and organic/inorganic matter particles between barrier and pool habitats at a small spatial scale within a karst barrage hydrosystem (Plitvice Lakes). Benthos and drift were sampled seasonally between November 2006 and July 2007 at four sampling sampling sites representing barrier (B; fast-flow velocity) and pool (P; slow-flow velocity) habitats. During the entire study period, amounts of drifting macroinvertebrates, and organic and inorganic particles were significantly higher at barriers than in pools. In benthos, such barrier trend was found for moss only. Considering seasonal differences, benthos showed no significant trends, whereas in drift we found significantly higher loads of all measured items in autumn and winter than in other two seasons, but such trend was observed at barriers only. The quantities of organisms in benthos and drift greatly followed the respective trends of particulate organic and inorganic matter, especially moss. At both habitat types macroinvertebrate drift mostly presented a smaller proportion of total benthos faunal composition, although there were some taxa that occurred in drift or benthos only. In total (including benthos and drift samples), we found 63 taxa during the study - 5 of them were found only within pools, 38 only at barriers and 20 of them were found at both habitat types. The most dominant in both benthos and drift, were Oligochaeta, cladoceran Alona spp., Copepoda, and larval stages of coleopteran Riolus spp. and dipteran Simulium spp. Most of them belong to mobile, epiphytic and/or interstitial detritivores that most likely originated from the submerged aquatic vegetation (i.e., moss), floating leaf litter and/or sediments along our study reach, whereas cladoceran and copepod taxa likely originated from the upstream lake. The observed seasonality in the faunal drift-benthos composition (e.g., Cladocera increase in summer and autumn, Ephemeroptera decrease/absence in winter and spring), was likely a consequence of the seasonal food sourcing for individual taxa, and their particular life history traits. Our findings suggest that within the tufa-precipitating Plitvice Lakes hydrosystem: a) drift has a very important role in maintaining benthos structure and stability within the barrier and pool habitats; b) tufa barriers are highly dynamic habitats, characterized by pronounced season-specific dislodgement of the benthic organisms and particulate matter, and effective moss-mediated macroinvertebrate dispersal; c) the abundance of macroinvertebrates and the amounts of organic/ inorganic particles in drift are influenced not only by flow velocity and the seasonal lake discharges/ biocommunity dynamics, but also by the initial distribution of particles/organisms within benthos as well as by the life history traits of the individual benthic organisms. © 2015, Croatian Natural History Museum.

This has led to changes in species composition, heavy loss in species diversity and a decrease in bryophyte cover. Fen restoration is complicated by an effective nutrient uptake and utilization of Molinia. Experimental tests of the effects of litter removal and different mowing regimes on restoration success are needed together with studies that compare the responses of different taxonomical groups. 2. We applied three different types of restoration measures (once- and twice-a-year mowing, litter removal) in a block experiment over 6 years to test the effects on species density and composition of vascular plants and bryophytes. We used repeated measures anova, RDA with the Monte Carlo test and principal response curves. 3. Species density and composition of both taxonomic groups were significantly influenced by mowing, but not by pure litter removal. Contrary to bryophytes, vascular plant species composition was more strongly influenced by twice-a-year mowing than by annual mowing. Vascular plant species density sharply increased after 2 years in both annual and bi-annually mown plots, to a greater extent in the latter. 4. Late-spring nutrient concentrations in Molinia varied inconsistently across the years, but showed a trend of lower K-concentrations in mown plots. The tissue N:P ratio indicated P-limitation. 5. Using nine sub-plots within each experimental plot, we found that Bryum pseudotriquetrum was able to spread quickly over the mown plots, while some other typical fen bryophytes (Fissidens adianthoides, Palustriella commutata, Scorpidium cossonii) were unable to increase in frequency, perhaps due to a low generative reproduction and weak competitive ability. 6. Synthesis and applications. Molinia-invaded fen vegetation can be restored through intensive mowing. We recommend twice-a-year mowing instead of traditional late annual mowing as an initial restoration measure. Since the effect of the standing Molinia crop in our long-abandoned fen turned out to be more detrimental to other plants than accumulated litter, we do not recommend any management that is based on litter removal rather than mowing. © 2009 British Ecological Society.},

	abstract = {Spring habitats are highly diverse and have a mosaic microhabitat structure. They are endangered by diffuse exploitation as drinking-water resources, an impact likely to increase with climate change. Diatoms were sampled from stones and bryophytes in 110 nonthermal, near-natural springs in the southeastern Alps (Trentino) and 16 carbonate springs in the Dolomiti Bellunesi National Park. Fuzzy clustering identified 6 assemblages in the main types of springs. Carbonate rheocrenes hosted Achnanthidium spp., Gomphonema elegantissimum, and Nitzschia fonticola. Several of these species are rheophilic. This group was divided into 4 subassemblages defined by decreasing A. lineare and increasing A. pyrenaicum with increasing flow. Carbonate rheocrenes with shading or moderate NO3- enrichment contained a majority of sciaphilic and NO3-tolerant taxa: Cocconeis taxa, Amphora spp., Caloneis fontinalis, Reimeria spp., and Eunotia arcubus. Well-buffered siliceous rheocrenes supported Diatoma spp., Eunotia minor, Encyonema minutum, Navicula exilis, and Planothidium lanceolatum. Many of these species are heliophilic and rheophilic. Carbonate rheocrenes with lower conductivities or seasonal desiccation contained typical taxa of unstable environments: Diadesmis spp., Planothidium frequentissimum, Meridion circulare, and Achnanthidium dolomiticum. Carbonate rock-face seepages and some tufa springs supported xerotolerant diatom species with a preference for higher conductivities: Encyonopsis spp., Delicata spp., Gomphonema lateripunctatum, Denticula spp., and Cymbopleura spp. Siliceous seepages and pool springs, some very-low alkalinity rheocrenes, and 1 iron spring were characterized by acidophilous mire taxa, such as Eunotia spp., Frustulia crassinervia, and Tabellaria flocculosa, and very-low-alkalinity indicators, such as Psammothidium acidoclinatum. The other iron springs harbored species-poor assemblages with low numbers of cells. Many diatom species showed a significant preference for stones or bryophytes. Epibryon had higher richness and diversity than epilithon, and mean diversity did not differ among the most frequent bryophyte species. Bryophytes are quick and easy to sample and are proposed as the target substratum for diatom-based assessments of springs. © 2012 The Society for Freshwater Science.},

	abstract = {In this paper, three-dimensional mesoporous calcium carbonate-silica frameworks have been created from the straw tufa (ST) originating from porous fossil bryophyte by a thermal activation technique. A batch of adsorption kinetic and thermodynamic experiments were used to investigate the adsorption capacity of Cd(ii) onto the samples. The ST after thermal activation has shown a significant ability for the uptake of heavy metals. It exhibited maximum adsorption capacities of 12.76 mg g-1, 14.09 mg g-1, 17.00 mg g-1, and 33.81 mg g-1 for Cd(ii) at the activation temperature of 300, 450, 600 and 750 °C, respectively. Through competitive adsorption for Cd(ii)and Pb(ii), the ST thermally activated at 750 °C exhibited maximum equilibrium adsorption capacities of 24.65 mg g-1, 25.91 mg g-1, and 30.94 mg g-1 for Cd(ii) uptake at 298.1 K, 308.1 K and 318.1 K, respectively, whereas it exhibited values of 91.59 mg g-1, 101.32 mg g-1, and 112.19 mg g-1 for Pb(ii) removal. The adsorption capacities of Cd(ii) and Pb(ii) both decrease with the addition of the other heavy metal cations, indicating that the adsorption is hindered by the competitive adsorption and the adsorption active sites on the mineral surface are readily exchangeable. The adsorption of Cd(ii) and Pb(ii) followed the pseudo-second order kinetics model well. In addition, the Langmuir model could accurately describe the adsorption isotherms. Based on the results of characterization with TEM, XRD and XPS, the adsorption mechanisms could be primarily explained as formation of Cd(OH)2 and CdCO3 as well as Cd(HCO3)2 precipitation on the surface of ST. These characteristics of ion-exchange and the adsorptive property for ST modified allow it to be widely used in artificial wetland landfill and environmental protection. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.},

	abstract = {Calcareous spring fens are among the rarest and most endangered wetland types worldwide. The majority of these ecosystems can be found at high latitudes, where they are affected by above average rates of climate change. Particularly winter temperatures are increasing, which results in decreased snow cover. As snow provides an insulating layer that protects ecosystems from subzero temperatures, its decrease is likely to induce stress to plants. To investigate the sensitivity of the bryophyte community – key to the functioning of calcareous spring fens – to changing climatic conditions, we studied the annual variation in ecophysiology of two dominant bryophytes: Campylium stellatum and Scorpidium scorpioides. Further, a snow removal experiment was used to simulate the effect of changing winter conditions. In both species, we observed lowest efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) in spring, indicating physiological stress, and highest chlorophyll-a, -b and carotenoid concentrations in autumn. Snow removal exacerbated physiological stress in bryophytes. Consequently Fv/Fm, pigment concentrations and chlorophyll to carotenoids ratios declined, while chlorophyll-a to -b ratios increased. Moreover, these effects of winter climate change cascaded to the growing season. C. stellatum, a low hummock inhabitor, suffered more from snow removal (annual mean decline in Fv/Fm 7.7% and 30.0% in chlorophyll-a) than S. scorpioides, a hollow species (declines 5.4% and 14.5%, respectively). Taken together, our results indicate that spring fen bryophytes are negatively impacted by winter climate change, as a result of longer frost periods and increased numbers of freeze-thaw cycles in combination with higher light intensity and dehydration. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The hunter-fly genus Limnophora (Muscidae: Coenosiinae) is an important component of running water assemblages. Both adults and larvae are predators, the adults mostly feeding on blackflies (Simuliidae) and other small aquatic insects. This study was conducted at two tufa barriers in Plitvice Lakes National Park (NP) (tufa barrier Labudovac and tufa barrier Kozjak-Milanovac) and at two tufa barriers in Krka National Park (NP) (tufa barrier Roški slap and tufa barrier Skradinski buk). Adults were collected monthly from February 2007 until December 2013 at Plitvice Lakes NP and from September 2013 to October 2014 at Krka NP, using pyramid-type emergence traps. Over the 7-year study period at the Plitvice Lakes tufa barriers, a total of 193 specimens belonging to 6 species were collected, while during the 1-year study period at the Krka tufa barriers a total of 848 specimens belonging to 4 species were collected. Abundance of Limnophora specimens at the Krka NP sites were up to 30 times higher than at the Plitvice Lakes NP sites, which could be attributed to higher levels of potential food and higher water temperatures. The dominant species at the Plitvice Lakes sites were Limnophora pulchriceps and Limnophora riparia. At the Krka tufa barriers, the dominant species at site Roški slap was Limnophora croatica and at site Skradinski buk Limnophora riparia. The highest numbers of emerging specimens at all sites were present in the summer months. At the Plitvice Lakes sites most species were univoltine or bivoltine, while at the Krka sites most species were multivoltine. Water temperature was the main factor influencing the timing of emergence and the duration of the flight period. The highest abundance of Limnophora species was recorded over moss substrate. A significant positive correlation emerged between the numbers of emerging prey and the numbers of emerging specimens of Limnophora. These results give a new insight into the microhabitat preferences and prey-predator relationships of Limnophora. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Previously unknown and particularly well developed, active, inactive and old calcareous speleothem and tufa deposits occur in Newtrain Bay on the north coast of Cornwall. The speleothems are comparable with the better known cave deposits of Holywell Bay farther south, hitherto regarded as unique in Cornwall. The filamentous algal, moss-covered and indurated subaerial tufas are also significant in cementing rockfalls associated with coastal erosion. The tufas are composed of mainly low-Mg calcite with micritic to sparitic textures. Cave deposits comprise dense laminated flowstones, spar coatings, rimstone dams and dripstone/stalactitic speleothems containing mainly low-Mg calcite. Stable isotope analysis of selected tufas and a speleothem indicates slightly depleted δ13C (average-12.07) and significant δ18O enrichment (average-2.59) relative to typical northern European continental tufas. Water chemistry at active tufa and speleothem sites differs to that observed at cool freshwater carbonate deposition sites elsewhere in Europe in that electroconductivity, dissolved Mg, Na and chloride levels are relatively high. Circulation of sub-aerial groundwater combined with seawater aerosols in the vadose zone is considered significant but further work is required to determine the relative activities of Ca and Mg in the formation of these deposits and to clarify their origin. Tentatively we suggest that structurally-controlled, bedrock-derived and saline groundwater, flowing through weathered and jointed calcareous argillites, be considered a major contributory source of Ca and Mg for the development of coastal tufa and speleothems in Newtrain Bay.},

Tufa facies at Brandfontein include cemented colluvial and fluvial gravels and boulders, moss tufas, as well as reed and root facies. The sequences provide evidence of several cut and fill phases which are interpreted as indicating alternating periods of tufa deposition and fluvial downcutting. The Brandfontein tufas are used to propose a three phase arid fluvial tufa deposition model in which erosive high magnitude, low frequency floods punctuate periods of quiescence and tufa deposition. Extensive downstream prograding ramped barrages and tufa cemented fluvial gravels are key components of this tufa deposition model, which illustrates the role of climate and topography in shaping tufa deposit morphologies. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Relict vegetation of water-splashed petrifying rocks with calcareous tufa formation dominated by the fern Adiantum capillus-veneris and wetland bryophytes (phytosociological class Adiantetea) was investigated in Georgia, Caucasus biodiversity hotspot. The study brings the first phytosociological data on this scarce community in the Caucasus based on a novel dataset of vegetation plot records. A classification analysis revealed two main vegetation communities. They are represented by the Caucasian community recorded in the Mtkvari River valley inside the Tbilisi city (E Georgia) and the Colchic community developed under the humid, warm-temperate climate of Colchis (W Georgia), one of the key refugia of Tertiary flora across W Eurasia. To compare newly recorded vegetation types and so far described associations of the Adiantetea class, we used a broader dataset of the analogous communities reported from Europe and surroundings. It associated the Caucasian community with the pan-Mediterranean association Eucladio-Adiantetum. It was characterized by subhalophytes (e.g. Samolus valerandi), Eucladium verticillatum as a dominant bryophyte, and the absence of relict or endemic vascular plant species. The Colchic community represented a previously undescribed community. Therefore, we designated a new association Saxifrago cymbalariae-Adiantetum capilli-veneris delineated by the characteristic species of the Colchic-Caucasian territory (e.g. Hedera colchica, Saxifraga cymbalaria) and Palustriella commutata as the dominant bryophyte. Both associations belong to the Mediterranean-Atlantic alliance Adiantion. Described communities require conservation attention for their rarity, refugial character and presence of relict and endemic species. Modifications of the hydrological regime and construction activities are among their most important potential threats. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Plant Science and Biodiversity Centre, Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAS), Institute of Zoology, Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAS), Institute of Molecular Biology, Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAS) 2023.},

	abstract = {Stoneflies are among the most sensitive aquatic insect taxa and therefore arguably the best indicator of the excellent, i.e. pristine, ecological status of surface streams. Karst habitats are one of the most exciting freshwater habitats in terms of biological-geological interplay. They, in turn, support a biodiversity far superior to surrounding freshwater habitats and hence these habitats are designated as biodiversity hotspots. Our study deals with both of these crucial ecological players. We studied stonefly assemblages, their microhabitat preferences and emergence patterns along a karst oligotrophic hydrosystem. The sampling was conducted monthly from March 2007 to December 2008 using pyramid-type emergence traps set in various habitats and associated microhabitats (e.g. springs, rivers, streams, tufa barriers × moss, angiosperm, cobble, sand, silt substrates). Favorable environmental conditions, such as a wide range of karst habitat types with low water temperature and high oxygen concentration, resulted in high stonefly species richness (31 recorded species). Water temperature and pH had the highest influence on stonefly assemblages. Species richness and diversity decreased in a downstream direction. We recorded a longitudinal shift from crenal-epirhithral to epirhithral-metarhithral assemblages with some hyporhithral and potamal elements. Upstream sites were dominated by shredders, while downstream sites had a higher proportion of gatherers-collectors. Several species showed a significant preference for a specific microhabitat type in accordance with their feeding strategies and food availability. The majority of recorded species exhibited univoltine life cycles slow or fast. © 2018, Page Press Publications. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Holocene calcareous tufa deposits are located in the north-central sector of the state of Hidalgo, Mexico. These deposits outcrop on the Upper Jurassic Chipoco Formation in the Molango Manganese District. Calcareous tufa deposits correspond to carbonate formations of inactive tufas disconnected from the current hydrological network. To better understand the textural, geochemical, and biological characteristics and environmental conditions during their formation, a detailed study involving field analysis, X-ray diffraction analysis, X-ray fluorescence analysis, and morphometric analysis with light microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy was carried out. Similarly,14 C analysis was undertaken to determine the age of the deposit. On this basis, two biofacies were defined, one with stem structures and the other with Phyto clasts, bryophytes (Plagiomnium cuspidatum), and copepods, limited both at the base and the top by lenticular-shaped erosive surfaces and sigmoidal clinoforms. These bio facies formed in lacustrine and paludal environments, and barrier waterfalls. From a geomorphological point of view, the accumulations of these cal-careous tufas originated on slopes and/or at the foot of karstic springs, where the accumulation of material originated from the height of the spring with respect to the bottom of the valley, giving rise to a set of stepped tuffaceous plains with a wedge-shaped profile, colo-nized by important masses of bryophyte mounds, copepods, and vascular plants. This suggests a swampy environment where sedimentation took place in shallow water accumulations, where there is clear evidence of exposure and pedogenetic modification, indicating wet and dry episodes that translate into seasonal fluctuations in the water table. Six mineral phases were observed including silicates, carbonates and arsenates. The14 C analysis indicates that the plant found in the charcoal sample within the calcareous tufa deposit is of Holocene age. © 2024, Croatian Geological Survey. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A three-year study of modern carbonate sedimentation was conducted through analysis of sedimentological and hydrochemical parameters measured every six months at 10 sites along a high-slope river in northeastern Spain (River Añamaza). Three stretches of the river were characterised. The dominant water inputs from the upstream karstic springs, primarily from the Jurassic rock aquifer, determined the SO4-HCO3-Ca composition of the river water. From this area, decreasing trends in alkalinity, calcium and total dissolved inorganic carbon occurred downstream in both the warm and cool periods as a result of calcite precipitation. Tufa thickness variations were consistent with such hydrochemical evolution. Deposition rates increased downstream, primarily where the gradient is steeper (middle stretch), and subsequently decreased at the downstream gently sloped stretch. Therefore, the slope along the river and the distance from the main upstream springs conditioned the spatial distribution of tufa deposits by determining the chemical characteristics of the water.The monitored sites represent four primary fluvial subenvironments with distinct sedimentary facies. The highest carbonate deposition rates were measured in fast-flow conditions (stromatolites, facies A). Deposits with calcite-coated algae and mosses (facies C) formed in cascades and small jumps with very fast-flowing water exhibited lower deposition rates and typical erosion. Lower rates corresponded to slow flow conditions in which thin stromatolite crusts and/or filamentous and calcareous algae and tufa fragments (facies B) accumulated. In slow-flowing water areas near springs (upstream stretch) calcite was absent, linked to the higher pCO2 of water; microbial films and aquatic flora composed the biofacies (facies D) in such subenvironment. Therefore, tufa deposition rates in each fluvial subenvironment were controlled by the amount of CO2 outgassing linked to local flow conditions, the biological substrate type and the chemical attributes of the water along each stretch.A six-month pattern of deposition rates, best marked in the steeper stretch, was recorded from thickness measurements (spring+summer periods=4.30mm; autumn+winter periods=1.22mm). Parallel variations were recorded using PWP (Plummer, Wigley, Parkhurst) and calcite mass balance calculations. Multivariate statistical analyses (HCA and PCA) clearly separated hydrochemical and sedimentological attributes in samples from warm and cool periods. Exceptions to this pattern were related to changes in the water discharge; high discharge events caused the dilution of the chemical composition and erosion of the tufa deposits. Therefore, temperature-dependent factors (i.e., physico-chemical and biological processes) coupled with discharge changes controlled the seasonal variations in deposition rates. The stable-isotope composition of calcite and river water also reflected the discharge effects. However, the seasonal variation signature of temperature was preserved in the δ18O of sediment. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Pulsatilla patens has a circumpolar distribution from Eurasia to North America. This species occurs in the central and central-eastern parts of Europe, where is a rare and threatened species. In Poland, the largest number of sites is found in the north-east. A study on populations of P. patens was carried out in 2009-2010, at two wildlife refuges of the NATURA 2000 (N2000) network situated in North-Eastern Poland. Local names are following: the "Sejneńskie Lake District" (SLD) and the "Grasslands in the Military Training Grounds in Orzysz" (GMO). The current population structure of P. patens was estimated including the number, density and structure of different life cycle stages. Seventy-nine research plots of 2 m × 2 m were established at sites: dry heath, xeric sand calcareous grassland and pine forest. In each plot, all individuals were recorded and classified into life cycle stages: juvenile, vegetative and flowering individuals. The studies were carried out twice a year - in spring, during the full bloom of Easter pasque flower and in summer, in time of its fructification. The bioindication method was applied in order to determine the climatic and soil conditions of the habitats. Relationships were estimated between these population characteristics and habitat-related features such as the cover of phanerogams, cryptogams, litter, and bare soil. The population found on the GMO, was composed of 316 individuals which gives the density 6.4 ind. per plot while the one in SLD consisted of 202 individuals which gives the density 6.7 ind. per plot. The age structure of the populations proved that these were stable populations. This was evidenced by a large share of vegetative individuals - in both populations they prevailed (ca 64%). The highest share of juvenile individuals was noticed at the sites characterized by a moderate cover of cryptogams (21-35%). The analysis of correlations showed that on the non-forest habitats - dry heath and xeric sand calcareous grassland, the total number of individuals and number of vegetative individuals were negatively correlated with the cover of phanerogams and the cover of cryptogams. It was recorded negative impact of dense moss layer on the number of juvenile individuals. Moreover, the cover of litter had negative influence on the total number of individuals, number of juvenile and vegetative individuals. In contrast, the total number of individuals and number of juvenile individuals at that sites was positively affected by the cover of bare soil. A positive correlation was found between the number of vegetative individuals and phanerogams, and also between the number of juvenile individuals and the cover of bare soil at forest habitats. Negative impact on total number of individuals and the number of flowering individuals is exerted by the cover of cryptogams. Considering the ecological indicators set for the plant communities in which Pulsatilla patens appeared, it should be concluded that these were the habitats characterized by moderate light and moderately warm climate condition. The communities with Pulsatilla patens grew on dry and fresh soils, oligotrophic and mesotrophic ones, composed of sand and argillaceous clay. The pH ranging was from moderately acidic to neutral. The analysis of the age structure of the examined populations, the latter can be said to be stable. It can therefore be assumed that the Eastern pasque flower has met the favorable habitat conditions at the analyzed sites, therefore it is justifiable to claim that these sites will exist in the future and will constitute an important part of the resources of this species in Poland.},

	abstract = {We examined seasonal patterns of drifting macroinvertebrates, and transported moss and (in)organic particulate matter at a fine spatial scale within the tufa-depositing barrage hydrosystem of Plitvice Lakes, Croatia. Samples were collected at six sites along a stream reach during autumn, winter, spring and summer. The sampling sites differed in flow velocity, depending on their position within the study reach and distance from tufa barriers and associated waterfalls. Seasonality was pronounced for most physico-chemical measurements. The highest concentrations of transported (in)organic particulate matter, being related to increased amounts of moss in transport, were observed in autumn. Drift densities were highest at tufa barriers that had higher flow velocities. Drift abundance partially followed the seasonal pattern in transported (in)organic matter. Autumn peaks in drift of Oligochaeta, Coleóptera as well as some Diptera and Trichoptera were related to increased moss and particulate matter quantities, while observed increases in drifting Nematoda, Cladocera, Copepoda, Ephemeroptera, Simuliidae and Chironomidae in spring and summer were probably due to distribution shifts of larvae or to higher seston levels originating from the upstream lake. Although we found that faster flowing stream sites generally had higher drift densities, there typically was no significant correlation between flow velocity and the amount of drift. Therefore, our expectation that fine-scale spatial drift patterns primarily depend on flow differences between lotie habitats was not supported for this system. The positive correlation between transported moss and other measured drift parameters, both at the seasonal and fine spatial scale, suggests that drift patterns were influenced by trapping/refuge efficiency of moss-covered tufa substrate and respective seasonal changes in instream vegetation (moss) as linked to hydrochemistry and water temperature. © 2011 E.

The cascade lake system was formed in conditionsfavourable for the deposition of calcium carbonate (tufa). The growth of tufa barriers also depends on hydrological conditions, and is adversely impacted by erosion processes and changes associated with increased nutrientconcentrations (nitrogen and phosphorus), which lead to eutrophication.

Algae growing in mine effluents can sequester metals through adsorption onto cell walls and by absorption. Charophytes are a specialized group of algae that grow in temperate freshwaters and in alkaline mine waste water. They can hyperaccumulate radium and uranium, as well as many other cations. Their calcium carbonate infused cell walls are also a sink for carbon dioxide, making them very useful biological polishers. Boojum Research has studied mine waste water in many places and noted a number of situations where algae and charophytes may be useful for cleansing metals and radionuclides. Algae are capable of surviving and growing in effluents with pHs as low as 0.8, but due to the lack of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), do not grow well. To give them more DIC, the pH needs to be above 4.0, where bicarbonate becomes the dominant form. To accomplish this, the pH must be elevated. This can be accomplished by a number of means, but the most ecologically sensitive method is to dissolve magnesium metal or alloys. This technology is discussed in detail. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {Moss tufa, a significant filtration system in karst environments, plays a crucial role in intercepting heavy metals in water and ensuring aquatic ecological security. However, studies on the superimposed effect of multi-filtration moss tufa systems on intercepting heavy metals in water are scarce. Thus, this study focused on three adjacent moss tufa filtration systems (upstream, midstream, and downstream) as research subjects. Ecological importance value, niche width, interception rate, and enrichment coefficient were utilized to analyze the interception effect of these systems on heavy metals in water. The findings revealed that multiple moss tufa systems exerted a superimposed effect on heavy metal interception. Moreover, within the three moss tufa filtration systems, mosses from 9 families, 11 genera, and 13 species were detected. Among them, Hydrogonium arcuate (Griff.) Chen was the dominant species with the widest niche width. The interception rates of the moss tufa filtration system for Cd, Fe, Cr, and Zn were 95.7 %, 88.3 %, 77.4 %, and 74.3 %, respectively, whereas those for V, Mn, Ni, Cu, and Pb ranged between 50 % and 65 %. Importantly, in the moss tufa filtration systems consisting of the upstream, midstream, and downstream, the tufa and moss respectively accumulated 3 and 2–3 times as much concentration as the single upstream. In conclusion, these study findings highlight that the moss tufa filtration system can purify the majority of heavy metals and that multi-filtration system of moss tufa exerts a superimposed effect intercepting heavy metals. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {High-resolution quantitative analysis of ostracod assemblages from 4.3-m-thick freshwater tufa-rich sediments, deposited during the last 12.8 ka in Lake Sinijärv, northern Estonia, yielded information on water level, trophic state conditions, and temperature changes since the late glacial. AMS 14C dates from aquatic mosses provided time constraints on the palaeoenvironmental development of the region. In the ostracod assemblage structure, four faunal zones (OFZ) were determined. The most significant change in the ostracod fauna occurred at 10,590 cal. y BP, when a typical littoral, polythermophilic fauna was replaced by a mostly sublittoral, species-rich meso- to stenothermophilic fauna. The ostracod data indicate two major low-water-level periods in the lake at 12,800-10,590 and 7,600-3,700 cal. y BP. Sediment analysis indicates the most intensive tufa precipitation occurred during these low stand periods, rather than during the warmest climate in Estonia between 8,000 and 4,500 cal. y BP. The late glacial low water level in the groundwater-fed Lake Sinijärv at 12,800-10,590 cal. y BP coincides partly with the regression in the Lake Peipsi basin (14,000-12,100 cal. y BP) and with the last drainage event of the Baltic Ice Lake at 11,600 cal. y BP. The low-water-level period in Lake Sinijärv occurred earlier than in lakes in the SE sector of Scandinavian glaciation. The change from low to high water level in Lake Sinijärv at 10,590 cal. y BP preceded the first post-glacial transgression events in the small lowland lakes of Estonia, southern Sweden, Poles'ye in Belarus, and Valday in NW Russia. In general, the mid-Holocene low-water-level period in Lake Sinijärv between 7,600 and 3,700 cal. y BP is concurrent with the regressions in the lakes of the SE sector of Scandinavian glaciation. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {In the Eastern Alps, both fossil spring limestones and actively limestone-depositing springs are common. The geological context and a few radiometric age data of fossil spring-associated limestones (SAL) mentioned herein indicate that they accumulated subsequent to the Last Glacial Maximum in the Eastern Alps (24-21 ka BP). Prevalent facies of the SAL deposits, active and fossil, including phytoclastic tufa, microbialites s.l., springstone, and moss tufa form, or formed, from (a) waterfall/creek systems, (b) hillslope-paludal systems, (c) moss-tufa systems, and from (c) foreland-type systems. Precipitated minerals include calcite and, at springs of elevated Mg/Ca ratio, magnesian calcite and aragonite. In a few limestone-depositing, oxygen-deficient springs with dissolved Fe2+, downstream, iron oxide precipitates ahead of CaCO3 (mineralogical zonation). Biota associated with calcium-carbonate deposition include cyanobacteria, green micro-algae, macro-algae, and mosses. Calcium-carbonate precipitation may be speeded by biological mediation, but mineralogy and polymorphy of precipitated CaCO3 are not biotically controlled. In the Eastern Alps, SAL deposits in total range from 190 to 2,520 m a. s.l., corresponding to mean annual temperatures of 10°C to less than 0°C. In altitudes below the continuous permafrost line (about 2,600-3,000 m a.s.l., depending on location), SAL deposition is chiefly controlled by proper balance between water supply and sufficient supersaturation for CaCO3, rather than by mean annual temperature. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {The Pleistocene and Holocene tufas of the Serra da Bodoquena (Bonito region, Brazilian Midwest) consist of several deposits related to a karstic system developed in the carbonatic rocks of Corumbá Group. Tufas currently forming in the Serra da Bodoquena area (Mimoso and Formoso rivers) were investigated for a better understanding of which environmental changes control the deposition of different types of tufa facies. The Mimoso River displays waterfalls, cascades, barriers and large pools as morphological elements. The topographic breaks on the bedrock of this river control the distribution of these main morphological elements. Five facies were identified: (i) stromatolitic boundstones, characterized by an alternation of dense and porous laminae; (ii) phytohermal boundstones, corresponding to bryophyte cushions; (iii) phytoclastic rudstones, formed by the accumulation of leaves and plant fragments; (iv) oncoidal rudstones, composed by coated grains with concentric laminae (oncoids); and (v) unconsolidated detrital sediment, formed by bioclasts and tufa fragments. SEM images indicated the presence of microorganisms such as Oocardium stratum Nägeli 1849 and Phormidium incrustatum Gomont ex Gomont 1892, as well as diatoms and fungi filaments colonizing tufa samples. On the other hand, the Formoso River is more sinuous, lacking significative topographic breaks and presents flooded sub-environments, such as inactive barriers and other shallow fluvial areas, containing unconsolidated detrital sediment, lime mud and oncoidal rudstones. No microbial remains have been observed. The Bonito region has a humid warm climate with a rainy summer season and a dry winter season, and temperatures barely varying through year. The seasonality of rainy and dry seasons influences both the physicochemical changes of water and, indirectly, the microbial communities of tufa. However, the very different facies displayed by each river, Mimoso and Formoso, are not directly linked to climate. The stepped profile of the Mimoso River allows fast flowing waters producing fast CO2 outgassing that leads to high calcite precipitation rates. The gentle slope of the Formoso River and its slow flowing waters leads to slow passive CO2 outgassing and photosynthesis controlling calcite precipitation at lower rates than in the Mimoso River. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Hand-collected seeds of Biscutella laevigata, Bromus erectus, Carex humilis and Linum perenne were sown on experimental plots with intact and removed moss layer. Germination percentages under controlled conditions in a germination chamber were about 80% for all species except for C. humilis (14%). No germination of C. humilis was detected throughout the field experiment. The moss layer significantly reduced germination and seedling survival of Biscutella, Bromus and Linum. On all plots, seed germination was highest in October 2003 and continued in spring and summer 2004 to a lesser extent. Seedling mortality was highest during dry periods in summer 2004 and 2005. In winter 2004/2005, mortality showed a peak on plots with removed moss layer, but not on plots with intact moss layer. This indicates a protective role of the moss layer against heavy frosts. The barrier function and shading caused by mosses were probably the most important factors with negative effect on germination and establishment of the studied vascular plants. Water deficiency and high temperatures seemed to be the main hazards for survival of young plants as the moss layer offered no protection against these factors. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

	abstract = {While the importance of conservation mowing for mesic grasslands is generally accepted, its use for fens and fen grasslands interspersed within agricultural land is still controversial. Although fens may persist naturally, ongoing environmental changes increase productivity and accelerate succession. These processes can be mitigated through conservation management with appropriate settings. However, long-term management experiments are challenging and provide only locally valid results. Here, we analysed vegetation data (bryophytes and vascular plants) from seven management experiments (spanning 3–20 years) conducted in Central European poor, moderately-rich, and calcareous spring fens (Czech Republic, Slovakia). Two of these experiments examined the effects of restoration of abandoned fens, while five experiments examined changes in mowing regimes in managed fens (cessation, intensification, delay to autumn, and litter removal). Data were analysed using unidimensional and multidimensional methods separately for the initial, extended, and entire period. Mowing had a statistically significant effect on species composition except for the shortest (3-year) experiment. Litter removal did not compensate for mowing. Mowing twice or delayed mowing significantly affected the species composition of calcareous fens. In all cases, cessation of mowing significantly reduced the richness of species, especially those of conservation importance. In contrast, any mowing of abandoned fens increased species richness. The effects of mowing intensification or cessation on species richness and composition of a restored calcareous fen were evident in the first 2–3 years. Other effects were initially weak or nonsignificant but later became stronger, such as mowing delay and restoration removal of litter, which became significant only after nearly 20 years. We found that cessation or restoration of mowing usually triggers a rapid vegetation change, whereas it can take decades to detect the response caused by changes in mowing timing.

	abstract = {Dixidae (Insecta, Diptera) are an interesting ecological component in freshwater ecosystems. They are merolimnic insects with larvae and pupae living in aquatic habitats while adults live in terrestrial habitats in close proximity to water. The goals of this study were to determine the phenology patterns of Dixidae and what influences them, to analyse their preference for microhabitats, and to determine the main ecological factors that have an influence on the composition of Dixidae. Adult Dixidae were collected monthly in the period from 2007 to 2008 at 10 sites, from 2009 to 2010 at four sites, and from 2011 to 2014 at three sites in the Plitvice Lakes National Park. Adult specimens were collected using pyramid-type emergence traps. A total of 1271 Dixidae were collected during eight years of study belonging to five species of the genus Dixa. Dixa submaculata was most abundant species at the spring and upper reach of Bijela rijeka Stream and the upper reach of Crna rijeka Stream. Dixa nebulosa was most numerous at the Kozjak-Milanovac tufa barrier site. Dixa puberula was the dominant species at the rest of the sites. Dixa puberula and Dixa submaculata were univoltine, bivoltine or trivoltine, depending on the site, while Dixa nebulosa was only univoltine. The highest diversity was recorded at the tufa barrier Kozjak-Milanovac, and the highest number of species, four species, was found at the upper reach of the Crna rijeka Stream. The greatest number of specimens was recorded at the Labudovac tufa barrier, 128 specimens in 2014. Water temperature is the main ecological factor that influences the phenology of Dixidae at the tufa barriers and lower streams. Discharge affected the abundance of Dixidae. Dixa puberula prefers moss as a substrate and a faster water velocity. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH},

The tufas are almost entirely composed of calcite with small admixture of quartz, illite and chlorite. These deposits indicate the biotic and/or abiotic origin of calcium carbonate. The tufas occur in the vicinity of map-scale and minor fault zones. They precipitate near fissure springs linked with small faults and fault rocks or seepages along them. Exposures with tufas occur along several oblique and lateral zones. The oblique zones are related to Białka and Biały Dunajec faults that have normal components. The lateral zones of tufa oc- currences are connected with lateral faults limiting the "zone of beds with gentle dips" and extensional brittle structures within the hinge of the synclinorium. The relationship of the tufa with brittle extensional structures suggests Quaternary tectonic activity of the Podhale Synclinorium that can be explained by continued uplift in the area studied.},

	abstract = {Dendritic calcite forms in an active cold-water tufa system in association with extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that discontinuously coat bryophytes and cyanobacteria. Dendrites consist of 100-200 nm thick calcite fibres that form 3D lattice-like domains. In each dendrite domain, fibres have three structurally equal orientations, which correspond in disposition to radii from the centre of a calcite unit cell to the convex triple face junctions on its surface. Fibres do not form in the orientation of the c-axis. The external form of each dendrite has the shape of half of a shortened octahedron, with an upper triangular surface parallel to the substrate. Dendrite nucleation takes place on or in microbial EPS, whether microbial cells are present or not, and is probably effected by attraction of Ca2+ cations to negatively charged EPS, together with CO2-degassing and concomitant pH increase of supersaturated spring water in stream splash zones. Ensuing dendrite growth is abiogenic and controlled by diffusion. Dendrite c-axes are perpendicular to the substrate, probably because the negative charge of EPS forces the orientation of Ca2+ and CO32- planes within the developing dendrite crystal to be parallel to the EPS film surface. Dendrites are eventually filled and overgrown by solid, syntaxial calcite, which gradually and completely obliterates the dendrites as more familiar calcite crystal forms develop. No trace of the dendritic nucleus remains in the rock record. Calcite crystal nucleation may take place by this mechanism in many marine and meteoric settings, given that microbial EPS is now assumed to be virtually ubiquitous in these environments. This phenomenon could contribute to the development of familiar fabrics such as marine micrite cement and fibrous calcite cement, radial ooids, peloids, 'abiogenic' stromatolites, sea floor precipitates, microbialites, tufa, travertine, speleothems, and some meteoric cements. It may also contribute to the substrate-normal orientation of c-axes of common cement fabrics. © 2005 International Association of Sedimentologist.},

	abstract = {Springs are biodiversity hotspots and unique habitats that are threatened, especially by water overdraft. Here we review knowledge on ambient-temperature (non-geothermal) freshwater springs that achieve sufficient oversaturation for CaCO3 -by physical CO2 degassing and activity of photoautotrophs- to deposit limestone, locally resulting in scenic carbonate structures: Limestone-Precipitating Springs (LPS). The most characteristic organisms in these springs are those that contribute to carbonate precipitation, e.g.: the mosses Palustriella and Eucladium, the crenophilous desmid Oocardium stratum, and cyanobacteria (e.g., Rivularia). These organisms appear to be sensitive to phosphorus pollution. Invertebrate diversity is modest, and highest in pools with an aquatic-terrestrial interface. Internationally, comprehensive legislation for spring protection is still relatively scarce. Where available, it covers all spring types. The situation in Europe is peculiar: the only widespread spring type included in the EU Habitat Directive is LPS, mainly because of landscape aesthetics. To support LPS inventorying and management to meet conservation-legislation requirements we developed a general conceptual model to predict where LPS are more likely to occur. The model is based on the pre-requisites for LPS: an aquifer lithology that enables build-up of high bicarbonate and Ca2 + to sustain CaCO3 oversaturation after spring emergence, combined with intense groundwater percolation especially along structural discontinuities (e.g., fault zones, joints, schistosity), and a proper hydrogeological structure of the discharging area. We validated this model by means of the LPS information system for the Emilia-Romagna Region (northern Italy). The main threats to LPS are water diversion, nutrient enrichment, and lack of awareness by non-specialized persons and administrators. We discuss an emblematic case study to provide management suggestions. The present review is devoted to LPS but the output of intense ecological research in Central Europe during the past decades has clearly shown that effective conservation legislation should be urgently extended to comprise all types of spring habitats. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Deposition of calcium carbonate from groundwater was examined on a moss, Didymodon tophaceus, from a Niagara Escarpment waterfall. A spectrophotometer on a polarizing microscope was used for interferometry. A second-order blue interference with an interference minimum around 620 nm was found when moss cell spaces were fully calcified. Filled cell spaces were often surrounded by empty cell spaces. Complete calcification of whole leaflets resulted in progressively higher orders of interference colors and a positive shift in interference minima. Calcified leaflets finally became cemented together, but each retained a weak extinction when rotated. Small calcareous spherulites (mean diameter 15.7 ±2.1 m) were found between leaflets. Spherulites exhibited first-order white interference with a Maltese cross that rotated when the polarizer and analyzer were rotated in tandem. A Nikitin-Berek compensator was tilted at 5.5 to give an interference minimum at 600 nm in the optical axis. Quadrants of spherulites with radii more or less in line with the tilting axis of the compensator had lower (P < 0.001) interference minima (535± 27 nm) than quadrants with radii more or less perpendicular to the compensator (659 ± 15 nm), thus indicating a radial internal structure.

	abstract = {This article reports evidence for biologically mediated precipitation of dolomite in a fresh water spring in the south-east of Spain. Build-ups in the spring consisted of calcite, minor dolomite, barite and gypsum crystals formed by the mineralisation of microbial biofilms and bryophytes. A detailed microscopic study, coupled with geochemical analysis of the dolomite-precipitating biofilms, showed that dolomite crystals occurred in association with living coccoid micro-organisms, providing strong evidence that micro-organisms play a fundamental role in the precipitation of this mineral. Many of the calcite crystals observed were associated with extracellular polymeric substances. Moreover, microbial involvement in the precipitation of calcite was further supported by the presence of living cyanobacteria within the calcite crystals. Two different types of build-up were found in the spring: soft spongy moss tufa and laminated crusts. Two types of crusts were identified as follows: simple pink crusts and laminated crusts, the latter forming in both sub-aquatic and sub-aerial environments. Sub-aquatic accumulation of simple detached pink crust fragments occurred sporadically. Both tufa and the carbonate crusts hosted cyanobacterial-dominated biofilms with different bacteria and diatoms and their extracellular polymeric substances. The δ13C values of calcite showed some biogenic involvement in the origin of this mineral. The δ18O values were similar in the tufa and carbonate crusts and corresponded to current climatological characteristics. The occurrence of different groups of minerals (carbonates and sulphates) in close spatial association with micro-organisms suggests the presence of different macro-environmental and micro-environmental conditions that facilitate mineral precipitation within biofilms. These findings extend the known range of aerobic microbial dolomites to include springs, and show that the precipitation of both dolomite and calcite carbonates occurs while organisms are alive. © 2013 International Association of Sedimentologists.},

The flora and vegetation of the calcareous spring fen in the protected area (natural monument) “Arkaulovskoye Mire” (Republic of Bashkortostan, Southern Urals Region) was investigated. The species recorded comprised 182 vascular plants and 87 bryophytes (67 mosses and 20 liverworts), including 26 rare species listed in the Red Data Book of the Republic of Bashkortostan and seven species listed in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation. The study area is notable for the presence of isolated populations of relict species whose main ranges are associated with humid coastal and mountainous regions in Central Europe. The vegetation cover of the protected area consists of periodically flooded grey alder-bird cherry forests, sedge-reed birch and birch-alder forested mire, sparse pine and birch forested mire with dominance of Molinia caerulea, base-rich fens with Schoenus ferrugineus, islets of meso-oligotrophic moss-shrub-dwarf pine mire communities, aquatic communities of small pools and streams, etc. Examination of the peat deposit indicates the occurrence of both historical and present-day travertine deposition. A retrospective assessment of the seasonal development of vegetation and surface temperature at Arkaulovskoye Mire, using earth observation data, suggests that the microclimatic conditions of the mire habitat can mitigate extremes of continental climate in the forest-steppe zone and thus support the survival of the mire’s relict floristic complexes. Finally, a comparison of climatic data between the Arkaulovskoye Mire and Nätsjöbäcken Mire in Sweden, which is a site for Schoenus ferrugineus within its main European range, shows that the annual temperature regimes of these two locations are rather similar. © 2020, IMCG and IPS.

	abstract = {The fabrics of the ~ 2200-year-old Wolfenden tufa deposit in southeastern British Columbia, western Canada, are characterized by innumerable radial spar-encrusted peloids of microbial-mediated micrite that partially to completely infilled the pervasive moldic porosity. Coalesced arrays of adjoined spheroids formed concentric growth layers within the moldic porosity. Peloid interiors, as well as other fabrics that encrust bryophyte biota and cyanobacteria, consist of micrite and microspar, rod-shaped mineralized EPS filaments, nanospheroids and hemispheroids of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), and monohydrocalcite (MHC) crystallites. The adsorption of EPS molecules in the calcium carbonate precipitate initially regulated the progressive dehydration of the ACC, thereby controlling the ACC–MHC–micrite transformation and ensured the preservation of the ACC nanospheroids as the initial stage of the transformation. This transformation sequence controlled the interior ultrastructure and mineralogy of the biogenic peloids. The mineral transformation sequence was altered by diminished adsorption of EPS-derived organic molecules and increased dominance of Mg2+ adsorption. This resulted in a direct ACC–calcite transformation without the intermediate MHC stage. This shift in the biotic-mediated/abiotic balance was concurrent with neomorphism of the peloid interiors and development of radial-spar cortices. The dominant Mg2+ adsorption resulted in a meshwork of needle-fiber calcite crystals within biofilm canopies on moldic porosity surfaces and ACC–MHC–calcite encrusted biota. In contrast, dominant abiotic Mg2+ adsorption without enveloping biofilms triggered the morphogenesis of individual needle-fiber calcite crystals during split crystallization. Neomorphism of the microbial-mediated calcite crystal structures with metallic ion adsorption permitted radial spar-jacketed peloids transforming into small ovoid crystal fans or bundles that recrystallized earlier cyanobacterial frameworks. Split crystallization enhanced this process as larger ovoid crystal fans expanded into abiotic radial-starburst arrays of bladed crystals as growth layers of moldic porosity. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Varied types of ooids and oncoids have been found in travertines and tufas along 3 km of Azuaje Ravine in the volcanic island of Gran Canaria. Ooids show spherical to ellipsoidal shapes, 0.1 mm->2 mm in size, and regular concentric smooth cortices. Oncoids are 0.4 mm to several millimetres in general, with slightly lamination, and generally irregular shapes. Mineralogy varies from aragonite and aragonite-calcite in travertine, to calcite in tufa. Nuclei in all cases are intraclasts, plant part moulds, or they are undistinguishable from the cortex. Coated grains layers commonly pass laterally to stromatolites, but also to other facies (rafts, hanging coated stems, bryophytes, etc.). In general terms, and considering the characteristics of nuclei and cortices, facies associations, and their distribution, coated grain deposits would represent several stages of: (a) availability of loose particles that serve as nuclei, (b) formation of coatings, (c) immobilization of the grains and (d) fossilization of the deposit as a consequence of crusting on it. All these stages would be related to specific physical, chemical, and biological conditions, and their variations, responding to the sedimentary dynamics of the ravine. Copyright© 2024 El Autor/a(s).

This paper describes the methodology followed to construct one of the first digital outcrop models of fossil tufas. This model incorporates 3-D lines and surfaces obtained from a terrestrial laser scanner, electric resistivity tomography (ERT) profiles, and stratigraphic and sedimentologic data from 18 measured sections. This study has identified seven sedimentary units (from SU-1 to SU-7) which are composed of tufa carbonates (SU-1; 3; 5; 6) and clastics (SU-2; 4; 7). Facies identified occur in different proportions: phytoherm limestones of bryophytes represent 43% of tufa volume, bioclastic limestones 20%, phytoherm limestones of stems 12%, oncolitic limestones 8%, and clastics 15%. Three main architectural elements have been identified: 1) Steeply dipping strata dominated by phytoherm limestones of bryophytes; 2) gently dipping strata dominated by phytoherm limestones of stems; and 3) horizontal strata dominated by bioclastic and oncoid limestones. The alternation of tufa growth and clastic input stages is interpreted as the result of climatic changes during Mid-Late Pleistocene. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..},

Location: The island of Ireland, north-western Europe. Methods: Vascular plants, bryophytes and abiotic variables were recorded in a field survey of 186 relevés (4 m2). Relevés were assigned to groups based on species composition, using fuzzy clustering and Indicator Species Analysis. Eight plant communities were described. Results: Group 1 Eucladium verticillatum-Pellia endiviifolia Tufa Cascades, of steep slopes, are related to Continental Eucladietum verticillati and Adiantion communities. Group 2 Palustriella commutata-Geranium robertianum Springheads and Group 3 Brachythecium rivulare- Platyhypnidium riparioides Tufaceous Streams and Flushes are woodland communities related to the Equiseto telmatejae-Fraxinetum and the Pellio endiviifoliae-Cratoneuretum commutati. Groups 1 to 3 fall broadly within the Brachythecio rivularis-Cratoneuretum forest spring vegetation type. Group 4 Palustriella commutata- Agrostis stolonifera Springheads are intermediate between Groups 1 to 3 and Groups 5 to 8. Group 5 Schoenus nigricans Springs, Group 6 Carex lepidocarpa Small Sedge Springs and Group 7 Palustriella falcata-Carex panicea Springs are transitional to Caricion davallianae small-sedge fen communities. Group 8 Saxifraga aizoides- Seligeria oelandica Springs are ecologically distinctive, species-rich assemblages confined to montane cliffs, with a restricted distribution in upland limestone regions, containing a number of nationally and internationally rare taxa. Of our eight groups, Groups 7 and 8 have the closest affinities with Cratoneuretum falcati spring communities. Abiotic variables differ significantly among the eight groups. Slope, macronutrient levels and shading by tree canopies are highly significantly related to the main axes of variation in the floristic data. Species diversity is inversely related to phosphate levels. Group 8 communities are irrigated by water of the highest pH and lowest solute concentrations. Conclusions: Our eight groups characterise variation within the habitat, elucidate ecological gradients with related habitats and facilitate conservation of this ecologically distinctive habitat. © 2016 Gebrüder Borntraeger.},

X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the tufas consist of low-Mg calcite, whereas macroscopic and microscopic analyses showed the presence of both allochthonous (clastic) and autochthonous components consisting predominantly of pisoliths, oncoids, intraclasts, lithoclasts, stromatolites and encrusted plant materials. These tufas form four facies associations that represent pisolitic intraclastic/lithoclastic oncoidal rudstones, phytohermal /bryophyte framestones, stromatolite-algal boundstones, and speleothem-like flowstones. These tufa associations were formed within a karstified carbonate terrain by a rainwater-fed paleospring system comprising waterfalls, slopes, dammed areas, lacustrines-paludal, and fluvial channel margin environments. Early diagenetic features are cementation, neomorphism and subaerial dissolution. Isotope-geochemical analysis indicated that the negative δ18O values (between – 13.26 and – 8.89‰ V-PDB) and the negative δ13C values (between – 3.16 and – 1.62‰ V-PDB) of the studied tufas are consistent with carbonates deposited from meteoric water in regions with much precipitation. © 2022, The Author(s).},

They are known, for example, from the strongly undulating young glacial landscapes of Central Europe, where many of them are protected by law. These include sites located in the Chociel River valley, in Western Pomerania (Northern Poland). One such spring-fed fen (Bobolice site) was investigated in detail using multiple methods (phytosociological, plant macrofossils, sedimentological and geochemical) for the current state of vegetation, reconstruction of its long-term development and, eventually, the identification of management strategies for its effective protection. Six developmental phases reflecting changes in the natural environment at the end of the Late Glacial and in the Holocene, as well as changes caused by human impacts in recent centuries, were identified for the investigated site. In the past, the dominant role in the formation of the spring-fed fen was attributed to sedge and sedge-moss communities, also with an admixture of Sphagnum in the last phase of the fen’s development. For about 300 years increased human activity has been recorded in the Chociel Valley, resulting in a modification of the water regime and a strong transformation of vegetation. Today, the real vegetation is therefore the result of both the presence of various mire habitats and various types of agricultural use. The current state of spring-fed fens in the Chociel River valley points to the urgent need for the implementation of various active protection measures. © 2018, The Author(s).},

The unit consists of three main asymmetrically distributed facies associations: palustrine carbonates, lacustrine carbonates, and tufa carbonate. This study evaluates the variations in their petrographic properties. The transition from alluvial environments to lake margins settings displays a shift from conglomerate and silt to lacustrine-palustrine mudstones to packstones. The palustrine carbonates include features such as pseudo-microkarst, root cavities, gypsum, nodular and mottled limestone that indicates a semi-arid climate with water level fluctuations. Lacustrine deposits contain charophytes, gastropods and ostracods, oncoids coated by iron oxide cement, oncoliths, and recrystallization of calcite which confirms that the lacustrine facies were deposited in shallow freshwater within a sub-humid climate. Tufa facies is represented by many sequences showing the alternation of marl/tufa or silt/tufa facies associations typified as a fluvial tufa barrage. Microscopic observations show four microfacies: porous tufa, algae filaments, moss tufa, and cyanobacterial tufa. These meteogene tufas are formed in a cool temperate climate. In the Bent Jedidi basin, the evaluation of facies associations along profiles indicates a significant impact of water level fluctuation on the formation of carbonate deposits formation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Spring fens are isolated treeless wetlands of a high conservation value. Their environmental conditions are strongly related to their groundwater chemistry, which controls species distribution within various groups of organisms. Clitellates, a dominant group of non-insect aquatic fauna, however, have never been studied in these habitats. It is unclear from previous studies to what extent the distribution of aquatic non-insect taxa reflects water chemistry rather than the substrate structure. We studied 34 spring fens sampled in 17 isolated sites in the Western Carpathian Mountains to determine mainly the effects of water chemistry and substrate structure on variation in species richness and composition of clitellate assemblages as examples of the non-insect fauna. A total of 34 taxa were found, with 3-15 taxa collected per sample. Species richness was negatively correlated with water mineral concentration measured as water electric conductivity (r = -0.57, P < 0.001) and positively with TOC (r = 0.60, P < 0.001). Surprisingly, the lowest number of taxa was found in calcareous fens and richness increased towards Sphagnum-fens. There was a species turnover related to changes in mineral richness and substrate characters. The main change of species composition was promoted by changes in substrate structure. The second gradient of species composition was linked with the amount of nutrients, moisture, and dominance of sphagna, and was associated with an increase of eurytopic species in fens with high nutrient availability. It was difficult to separate the effects of water chemistry and substrate on clitellate species distributions owing to the fact that variation in tufa precipitation and vegetation was driven by water chemistry changes. This study presented the first quantitative data on fen clitellate assemblages, which appear to have an unusual pattern of species richness. In contrast to plants and molluscs, calcareous fens appeared to be a harsh environment for clitellate species.

	abstract = {Patterns in aquatic Clitellata assemblage composition are known to be driven by several environmental gradients, with water chemistry and substratum characteristics being particularly important. In this study we explored 54 isolated spring fens across the eastern Czech Republic and Slovakia. These fens varied in calcium and magnesium concentrations, forming a sharp and well defined environmental gradient running from calcium-poor acidic fens to extremely calcium-rich tufa-forming fens. We found that the main changes in clitellate species composition were controlled by this gradient, and/or total organic carbon content, over a wide area, including fen sites differing in other environmental conditions and historical development. However, this pattern was weakened in sites with a high organic matter content, which represented a second driver of change in assemblage composition along with water temperature. Three main types of fens were determined using cluster analysis based on clitellate assemblage composition. However, only the first type, which included tufa-forming fens, was found to fit with the previously established spring fen types based on vegetation (i.e. extremely mineral-rich fens with a tufa, brown-moss mineral-rich fens, mineral-rich Sphagnum fens and mineral-poor Sphagnum fens). The second clitellate type included sites with low temperatures and occasional desiccation, while the third type was characterised by high temperatures and trophy. Using eight environmental predictors, we were able to significantly explain changes in the population abundances of all 12 common species (i.e. recorded at 15-plus sites). The results from individual species modelling also suggests that an increase in organic matter content can trigger compositional shifts towards assemblages of common eurytopic tubificid species. Thus, human-induced eutrophication and negative changes in spring fen hydrology, mainly drying up, can represent a serious threat for species-specific assemblages of aquatic clitellates, especially at alkaline sites due to their isolated and spatially limited nature. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.},

	abstract = {Several tufa complexes are known in the Slovak Karst which is a typical karst area of a temperate climate. This area is built of Mesozoic carbonates, mainly Triassic in age. The karst systems drain carbonate plateaux and lead water to resurgences located in valleys which are up to 300 m deep. Below the resurgences there are Holocene fossil tufa deposits that exceed 12 m in thickness. The tufas include stromatolite, moss, phytoclastic, oncoidal, and intraclasticfacies. Extensive barrages which once dammed the upper reaches of the streams were formed in narrow valleys. They are composed predominantly of moss facies and stromatolites, with subordinate oncoidal and phytoclastic facies. Phytoclastic, oncoidal and intraclasticfacies are dominant in dammed segments of streams, and include gastropod shells and charcoal fragments. Some small moss cushions are also developed. Barrages and dammed areas formed in a longitudinal fluvial depositional system. Conversely, below resurgences located on plateau slopes tufas of a perched springline depositional system were formed. These comprise deposits of prograding cascades constructed by moss, phytoclastic and stromatolitic facies. Presently, the tufas analysed are inactive. They stopped growing in the Late Holocene time, after which there was abrupt incision of the streams. This caused down cutting into Holocene tufas, in some places reaching Mesozoic bedrock. At present tufa is being precipitated from streams in all the sites studied.},

	abstract = {Mosses are an integral component in the tufa sedimentary landscape. In this study, we investigated the use of the porous moss-tufa structure as a filtration system for removing potentially toxic elements (PTEs) from water samples. Three species of mosses that commonly grow on tufa were selected, and the PTEs filtered by the moss-tufa system were identified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) of mosses was calculated to compare the enrichment effects of different mosses on PTEs. Likewise, the level of PTEs flowing through the moss-tufa system was measured, and the water quality removal rate (C) was calculated accordingly. The results revealed that the moss-tufa system was mainly composed of Fissidens grandifrons Brid., Hydrogonium dixonianum P. C. Chen, and Cratoneuron filicinum (Hedw.) Spruce var. filicinum. Among these, Fissidens grandifrons Brid. reported the highest retention capacity for PTEs. Collectively, the moss-tufa filtration system displayed a strong retention capacity and removal rate of Mn, Pb, and Ni from the water sample. The removal of PTEs by the moss-tufa system was mainly based on the enrichment of mosses and the adsorption-retention ability of tufa. In conclusion, the moss-tufa micro-filtration system displayed the effective removal of PTEs from water samples and could be applied to control the levels of toxic elements in karst water bodies. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Aims and background: Groundwater-dependent minerotrophic fens are globally threatened biodiversity hotspots. The supply of groundwater keeps their soil thermally stable and mitigates climatic extremes by thermal buffering. This stability has been shown to influence species composition variation at the between-site scale but has not been studied at the within-site scale. Methods: A total of 19 calcareous fens in the Western Carpathians were sampled for bryophytes, vascular plants, and terrestrial snails with three plots at each site along a watertable gradient, i.e. from the most waterlogged (plot A) through intermediately waterlogged (plot B) to the most terrestrial (plot C) areas. Temperature dataloggers were buried in each plot, and climate variables were derived from the climate database. Results: Water table depth and soil temperature were the most important factors influencing species composition. Significant differences were found between spring source area (A) and fen margin (C) plots for all taxa groups studied. Soil temperature played a significant role at the site level only for bryophytes and vascular plants. However, a large overlap between water table depth and soil temperature for bryophytes also suggests a synergistic effect of these two factors. Conclusion: Soil temperature plays an important role in promoting compositional variation of vegetation on the within-site scale (i.e. a pure effect of soil temperature) in groundwater-dependent mires, as we show here for the first time. This is essential in the light of ongoing climate change. Conservation measures should primarily focus on bryophytes as they are the most temperature-sensitive organisms and important ecosystem engineers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Algae and calcite were detected on leaves immediately after their expansion, with diatoms Achnanthes minutissima aggr., Denticula tenuis and Navicula cari var. cincta the most numerous. In terms of biomass (as biovolume) and surface area, Rhopalodia gibba was the most important epiphyte. The algal epiphytes attained maximum numbers 20-30 mm below the moss cushion surface and thereafter declined due to lack of light. Travertine (calcite) deposition increased in a linear fashion with cushion depth over the first 80 mm but with a lag in deposition at the stem apex. About 1 μg calcite was deposited per mm2 leaf/day. A significant association was found between the presence of the large diatom Rhopalodia gibba and calcite deposition but no associations were found with the remaining algae. The results suggest that Rhopalodia exerts a positive effect on calcite deposition by presenting a favourable physico-chemical microenvironment through biochemical (including photosynthetically-driven) processes. Travertine deposition continued well below the level where the moss leaves were photosynthetically active and below the level where the algae attained maximum abundance. Although diatoms have been shown to influence calcite precipitation, the deposition of travertine was considered to be controlled mainly by inorganic processes.},

These occur as stratified crusts in various dispositions and are also associated with moss-rich deposits. Morphologically, these vary from planar laminated crusts to columnar growths. Stromatolitic tufas are built with alternate lighter sparry and relatively darker micritic laminae in which possibly 'Phormidium', 'Scytonema' and ''Schizothrix' occur. Fibrous aragonite also occurs in microbial crusts radiating normal to laminae and at places forms bushy and spherulitic fabrics. Other microorganisms involved are diatoms, coccoid cyanobacteria, fungi and (?) bacteria. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope values indicate precipitation from ambient temperature waters, possibly in partial disequilibrium condition. A biogenic contribution from the soil zone to the carbon pool seems very likely. The deposition is largely effected due to inorganic precipitation. Calcification of the microbial community due to heterogeneous nucleation and trapping by mucilaginous cyanobacteria has resulted in surficial mineralization. Precipitation differences associated with cyanobacteria have formed alternate sparry and micritic laminae. These may indicate a seasonal variation in deposition.},

	abstract = {Both Recent and fossil tufa deposits from Belgium were studied by petrographical and geochemical means. Study of the Recent deposits provides information on precipitation conditions and on possible present-day biological influences of organisms on tufa precipitation. Comparative petrographical and geochemical investigations of both Recent and fossil deposits give information about diagenetic modifications. The Recent deposits form within small rivers, where they display two macro-types, i.e. precipitates on organic substrates (plants, mosses, algae, cyanobacteria) and laminated carbonate crusts. The latter occur on the river bed or on different substrates (limestone rocks, snail shells, artificial glass and limestone plates). Characteristic petrographical features are, on the one hand, horizontal laminations within the carbonate crusts, which relate to seasonal growth patterns of the present cyanobacteria on the other hand, the close association between the organic matter and carbonate precipitates in the actively forming deposits. Due to encrustation in growth position, the organic structures determine the overall structure of the precipitates. Characteristic crystal morphologies (pseudo-hexagonal crystals and penta-dodecahedral crystals on mosses and algae) and specific features (e.g. micritic cyanobacterial bushes) show possible direct influence of the organisms on calcite precipitation. The stable carbon isotope signature of the Recent deposits with a mean δ13C value of about -11.05‰ PDB points to a mixture of three possible CO2 sources, i.e. atmospheric-related CO2, recycled marine CO2 and biological CO2. The studied fossil deposits consist of granular detrital tufa and porous cascade tufa with precipitates on organic substrates and laminated carbonate crusts, which show similar characteristics to the macrotypes found in the Recent deposits. However, there are differences between Recent and paleo-deposits that can be attributed to diagenetic changes. Moulds and prints within the tufas are created by disappearance of the original matter. The fossil deposits are also characterized by the presence of sparry crusts that originate from cementation and recrystallization of initial micritic cyanobacterial bushes. Furthermore, specific calcite crystals such as euhedral, gothic arch, needle and needle fibre calcite crystals have been recognized. These are interpreted to have formed during phreatic and vadose diagenesis. The stable carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of the fossil deposits show a shift towards slightly less depleted values and smaller variation with respect to the Recent deposits. This feature is also interpreted in terms of diagenetic changes within the tufa deposits.},

	abstract = {The relationships of microstructure and vegetal remains, obtained by decalcification, were studied in Modern tufa from Burgundy, in order to try to link a given species with a particular crystal habitus. The edifices have various shapes (coatings on floors; encrusted pebbles, shells, vegetal shoots, mosses; oncolites; hydrodynamically shaped tufts). The biological content is rich in algae and animals, mainly at the proximity of springs, even if Phormidium incrustatum is the predominant species. It is associated with several species of Gongrosira, Schizothrix, and Oocardium stratum, the latter only known by its specific crystallizations. Among the animals, we point the galleries of Psychomiidae (Trichoptera = Phrygan) larvae. The algae and animals are associated within a "biological felt" (in the sense of FOREL, 1901).Some species are encrusted by calcite crystals of typical habitus (micrite: Phormidium incrustatum, Gongrosira and Schizothrix, ssp; sparite: Oocardium and Batrachospermum), and there are very little diagenetic modifications. The fabric results in an alternation of seasonal light laminations composed of juxtaposed bundles of Phormidium incrustatum α, and dark laminations due to parallel filaments of Phormidium incrustatum β. The influence of other algal species on shape and the internal fabric of the laminations is negligible. Phormidium incrustatum tufa are common in Western Europe, and probably have some fossil analogue in the Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary; they strongly differ from most older stromatolilic microstructures. Half of the studied tufa can suffer summer exposure and winter frost but related particular features do not seem to be preserved in the stromatolitic edifices.},

The δ13C values of Rivularia calcites deposited in summer were significantly higher than those deposited during winter. This was interpreted as the result of photosynthetic activity within colonies. The δ13C values were similar for the three cyanobacterium species studied, and colonies of Homoeothrix sampled over a 531‐m length of stream showed progressive downstream enrichment of 13C (2.0‰). This resulted from CO2 degassing of the downstream water, augmented during summer by bryophyte photosynthesis.

	abstract = {The Urrea de Jalon tufa deposits constitute the 20- to 50-m-thick caprock (0.3 km2) of an isolated mesa. They disconformably overlie horizontal strata of the Tertiary Ebro Basin (NE Spain), which contains a thick succession of lacustrine gypsum and marls, followed by limestones, marls and, locally, fluvial sandstones and mudstones. The tufa deposits show a complex, large-scale framework of basin-like structures with centripetal dips that decrease progressively from the base to the top of the tufa succession, and beds that thicken towards the centre of the structure (cumulative wedge-out systems). These geometries reveal that the tufa deposits were affected by differential synsedimentary subsidence. Distinct onlapping depressions reflect time migration of the subsiding areas. The studied carbonates are composed mostly of low-Mg calcite, with minor quartz. Some samples have anomalously high contents of Fe, Mn and Ba that may exceed 1% (goethite, haematite and barite are present). Carbonate facies are: (a) macrophyte encrustation deposits: (b) bryophyte build-ups; (c) oncolite and coated grain rudstones; (d) non-concentric stromatolite-like structures; (e) massive or bioturbated biomicrites; and (f) green and grey marls. Facies a and c show a great variety of microbial-related forms. These facies can be arranged in dm- to 2-m-thick vertical associations representing: (i) fluvial-paludal sequences with bryophyte growths; (ii) pond-influenced fluvial sequences; and (iii) lacustrine-palustrine sequences. The Urrea de Jalon tufa deposits formed in a fluvio-lacustrine environment that received little alluvial sediment supply. Isotope compositions (δ13C and δ18O) reveal meteoric signatures and accord with such a hydrologically open system of fresh waters. The Fe, Mn and Ba contents suggest an additional supply of mineralized waters that could be related to springs. These would have been discharge points in the Ebro Depression of a regional aquifer of the Iberian Ranges. Rising groundwater caused the solution of the underlying evaporites and the synsedimentary subsidence of the tufa deposits.},

	abstract = {Outcrop-scale geometries and bed relationships of ambient temperature freshwater carbonates are poorly understood because many described tufas have been dismantled by erosion and present only part of a particular depositional model. At the field scale, four end-member models encompass the tufa continuum: (1) perched springline; (2) paludal; (3) fluvial; and (4) lacustrine tufas. Individual bed types can occur with variable dominance within several of these models, but one or more beds are characteristically dominant only within a single tufa model, so it can be differentiated from relatively isolated outcrop fragments. Two models (perched springline tufas and paludal tufas) are known in outline only in the literature despite being present within the Quaternary deposits of most karstic regions. Perched springline tufas generally from lobate, fan-shaped mound morphologies on hillslopes and develop from single or multiple spring resurgences. Mature deposits show a subhorizontal top and a steep face on the downflow side. The steep outer zones of tufa mounds may be developed into cascades with moss curtains or can be dominated by shallow rimstone pools according to face angle. Tufa deposits lying downslope of the mounds are usually detrital in nature, especially if some dismantling of the mound has occurred. The relatively thin subhorizontal lobe-top deposits commonly contain organic-rich deposits. Paludal tufas develop predominantly in waterlogged valley bottom situations, where line-sourced waters emerge from valley side and bottom aquifers. Lime mud precipitation predominates in these sites. Mud is deposited as subhorizontal laminites that thin towards the valley axis and downstream of resurgences. Tufa spring-mounds may form where lesser volumes of water are involved. Individual tussocks (phytoherm cushions) of grasses and rushes are the most diagnostic feature of the model, but sapropels and peats may be intercalated. Diagenesis in both models is rapid. Lithification of individual beds is virtually instantaneous and always occurs before the decay of the associated living vegetation. The resulting highly porous and permeable fabrics remain fresh in Holocene tufas, but aggrading neomorphism and partial spar infill of vegetation moulds is common in older deposits. Dissolution in many perched springline tufas is small scale. Many large cavities are primary, but with later coatings of speleothems. Early removal of organics from paludal tufas is responsible for autobrecciation, and differential compaction.},

	abstract = {In the lotic aquatic biotopes on a tufa barrage in the Plitvice cascade lake system macroinvertebrate samples associated with a calcareous substrate covered with bryophytes and accumulated organic detritus were collected seasonally in four habitats with different current velocities. The aim was to investigate the interaction between the community features of macroinvertebrates and bryophyte cover associated with the selective retention and accumulation of particulate organic matter affected by different water flow conditions. In the tufa barrage habitats, depending on current velocity, bryophyte biomass varied seasonally from 55 g AFDW m-2 to 256 g AFDW m-2. Bryophyte biomass decreased in the tufa habitats exposed to higher current velocity. In the temporal succession from spring to autumn bryophyte biomass decreased, whereas in winter the biomass increased in all studied rheotopes. Regression analysis suggested that the bryophyte biomass significantly decreased linearly with an increase in current velocity. The bryophyte mats, which retained coarse (CPOM), fine (FPOM) and ultra fine (UPOM) benthic particulate organic matter as a food source for the detritial benthic macroconsumers, were significantly related to current velocity. CPOM and FPOM content of the bryophyte mats showed a tendency to increase in habitats with a lower current velocity. Conversely, UPOM content increased in bryophyte habitats with a higher current velocity. Regression analysis suggested that CPOM and FPOM increased whereas UPOM decreased significantly in habitats with a greater bryophyte biomass. In bryophyte habitats the community composition of macroinvertebrates was characterized by small forms of oligochaetes, dipterans and coleopterans constituting from 64.1% to 98.7% of the total number of macroinvertebrate individuals. Regression analysis suggested that macroinvertebrate density increased in faster water flow conditions associated with a decrease in bryophyte biomass, CPOM and FPOM, and an increase of UPOM. Macroinvertebrate community composition and species diversity showed significant differences among the four seasons and four water flow conditions associated with selective retention and accumulation of POM. In bryophyte habitats macroinvertebrate functional feeding composition was characterized by collector fauna increasing their density with faster water flow conditions. In spring and summer collector-gatherers were dominant whereas collector-filterers dominated in autumn and scrapers showed a maximum in winter. Regression analysis, using the power model (y = axb), suggested that densities of collectors and predators showed a positive relationship with the quantity of their food sources.},

	abstract = {A review of British Quaternary travertines is provided, including details of 159 sites presented as a cross-referenced coded list with a full bibliography. Almost all of these travertines were formed by the degassing of calcium bicarbonate waters. The ‘carrier’ CO2 originated from the soil and epigean atmospheres. At most sites, the travertine is composed of calcite as micrite or microspar, but aragonite occurs in the thermal waters of Bath Spa. The chemical composition of 20 samples gave an average CaCO3 content of 94.2% for active sites and 91.6% for inactive sites. Levels of Fe, Mg, Mn, P and Sr are also reported. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope compositions gave values consistent with the degassing of limestone waters in contact with a soil atmosphere. Some evidence indicated that photo-synthetic activity could also influence travertine deposition. Bryophytes and algae in particular, can influence travertine fabrics through the trapping and binding of calcite. The median δ13CPDB was −11.5‰. The British travertines have been classified into seven fairly broad categories: (1) paludal deposits; (2) cascades; (3) barrages; (4) stream/spring crusts; (5) lake crusts; (6) cemented rudites; and (7) clastic deposits. Spring/stream crusts and paludal deposits are the most common types of active and inactive travertines, respectively. Further statistics on deposit size, relation to solid geology and age are presented. Most sites are Holocene in age but the available dates do not point to a specific period of high travertine deposition, even though the Atlantic period (6000–7000 bp) is considered to represent such a time. Only a handful of travertines are known from the Pleistocene. © 1993, The Geologists' Association. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacteria-dominated biofilms involved in tufa deposition in the hardwater creek Deinschwanger Bach, Bavaria, were investigated with regard to their effect on the carbonate equilibrium and fabric formation. Current tufa deposition is evident by up to 1.5 mm thick crusts that have formed on substrate plates placed in the creek for 10 months. Hydrochemistry data indicate that carbonate precipitation along the creek is physicochemically driven by CO2 degassing, whereas photosynthetic carbon assimilation is without detectable effect on the macroscale carbonate equilibrium. However, stable isotope data indicate a minor photosynthetic effect, but only for the lower creek section where the pCO2 already drops to the two-fold of the atmospheric level. Though the initial process of external nucleation on cyanobacterial sheaths in the lower creek section might be promoted of by a photosynthetically-induced microscale pH gradient, the effect is not strong enough to cause a CaCO3 impregnation of the sheaths. The fabric of the laminated tufa crusts in the creek reflects the temporal alternation of porous microsparitic Phormidium incrustatum-Phormidium foveolarum-diatom biofilms in spring, micrite-impregnated Phormidium incrustatum - Phormidium foveolarum - diatom biofilms in summer-autumn, and detritus-rich non-calcified diatom-biofilms in winter. By contrast, exopolymer-poor surfaces of cascade tufa mosses show large, euhedral spar crystals. Non-phototrophic bacteria, which occur in large numbers in Phormidium incrustatum - Phormidium foveolarum - diatom - communities, thrive on extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and dead cells of the cyanobacteria and are unlikely to promote CaCO3 precipitation.},

The Zerqa-Ma'in phytoherm tufa is formed by encrustration of mosses and algae in which the rate of calcite precipitation is probably controlled by water turbulence. Calcite precipitates mainly as fibrous crystals containing an appreciable amount of crystallites and inclusion-rich zones. Trace element analysis of the tufa shows high concentrations of Sr and Mn which were probably derived from leaching of Triassic Ca-sulphates in the area and the mosses in the tufa, respectively. CaCO3 saturation index (S.I) values of the water indicate that the calcite in Zerqa-Ma'in tufa is precipitated mainly from biogenic activities.},

	abstract = {Waterfall tufa is widely distributed around the world, especially in tropical and subtropical karst areas. In these areas river water is generally supersaturated with respect to calcite, and the precipitation occurs mainly at waterfall and cascade sites. Development of waterfall tufa has been described as simply being the result of water turbulence. We believe, however, that three physical effects can lead to tufa deposition at waterfall sites: aeration, jet-flow, and low-pressure effects. The three physical effects are induced by two basic changes in the water: an accelerated flow velocity, and enlargement of the airwater interface area. These two changes increase the rate of CO2 out-gassing and the SIC, so that a high degree of supersaturation is achieved, which then induces calcite precipitation. These "waterfall effects" have been simulated in laboratory and field experiments, and each of them can accelerate, or trigger, calcite precipitation. Field measurements of river water chemistry also show that tufa deposition occurred only at waterfall sites. In these experiments and observations, waterfall effects play the most important role in triggering and accelerating CO2 outgassing rates. Field and laboratory observations indicate that plants and evaporation also play important roles in tufa formation. Growth of algae and mosses on tufa surfaces can provide substrates for calcite nucleation and can trap detrital calcite, accelerating tufa deposition. However, the prerequisite for such deposition at waterfall sites is a high degree of supersaturation in river water, which is mainly caused by waterfall effects. Evaporation can lead to supersaturation in sprays and thin water films at a waterfall site and cause the precipitation of dissolved CaCO3, but the amount of such deposition is relatively small.

	abstract = {At the Miette Hot Springs site, relict tufa stretches for nearly 500 m along the west side of Sulphur Creek valley and rises up to 30 m above the valley floor. The tufa, composed of low-Mg calcite, precipitated from waters discharged from a line of perched springs. 14C dating of bone material embedded in the tufa indicates that tufa precipitation took place between ∼4500 and 2500 years BP under cool and moist climatic conditions. The spring biota was dominated by filamentous microbes (mainly Phormidium and Oscillatoria), with fewer diatoms (including Cymbella), testate protozoans (including Quadrulella), ostracodes (including Darwinula, Heterocypris, Cadonia, and Cyclocypris), and various bryophytes. The ecological preferences of these microbes indicate that the spring water had near-neutral pH, was Ca, HCO3, and H2S-SO4 rich, and emerged at 50-65 °C. Landslides disrupted the west wall of Sulphur Creek valley during and after tufa growth. The relict tufa is divided into six morphotypes that reflect variations in water flow down the steep and rugged flow path. Domal tufa is located around the spring vents, roll-over tufa developed where water flowed over sharp lips or structural barricades, vertical tufa formed where calcite was precipitate from water flowing down steep to vertical inclines, flat-banded tufa reflects precipitation on a gentle slope, and wedge-shaped tufa formed where more rapid downslope calcite precipitation caused a progressive decrease in slope. The tufa contains stromatolitic facies (including streamer, porous laminar, dense laminar) and nonstromatolitic facies (bedded, crenulated) that reflect variations in the biology, water temperature, and style of flow of different parts of the spring flow path. © 2003 NRC Canada.},

The springs issue below a basalt lava at Matlock Bath at 20°C. Two springs deposit travertine (calcareous tufa) which covers an area of about 6 ha. The travertines consist of low magnesian calcite but with high levels of Sr, Pb and Zn. Their δ13C and δ18O values indicate deposition at or close to isotopic equilibrium with the springwater and confirm a soil-origin of the CO2 in the percolation water. The travertines form around the moss Cratoneuron commutatum which provides an open framework and is ultimately cemented with microspar to form a tough low-porosity deposit. Inactive travertines at the New Bath contain molluscan and pollen assemblages suggesting an open nitrophile woodland environment probably of Atlantic age or later.},
